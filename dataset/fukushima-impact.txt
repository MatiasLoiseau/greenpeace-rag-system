“The gap between nuclear rhetoric and nuclear reality has been a fundamental impediment to wise energy policy 
decisions for half a century now.”1 ~ Peter A. Bradford, Former United States NRC Commissioner2 
 
 
On 11 March 2015, the people of Japan will mark a tragic and somber anniversary. It will be the 4th year since 
the Great East Japan E arthquake and tsunami claimed tens of thousands of lives and triggered the beginning of 
the worst nuclear disaster in a generation: the triple reactor core meltdowns and destroyed  containment 
buildings at Tokyo Elec tric Power Company (TEPCO)’s Fukushima  Daiichi  nuclear power plant.  
 
In addition to the devastating environmental and human costs of this human -made3 nuclear disaster, the 
ongoing catastrophe also radically reshaped the energy landscape in Japan and will continue to impact the 
nuclear industry globally.  
 
Perhaps there is no more poetic  an indicator of the shift away from nuclear than the Fukushima Prefectural 
government stating in December 2012 that its first objective to revitalize the disaster -ravaged prefecture was, 
“building a safe, secure, and sustainable society free from nuclear pow er.”4 In 2014, the prefectural government 
followed through on that goal with a committed to a 100% renewable energy target by 2040.5 
 
In Japan, all forty -eight nuclear reactors (discounting  Fukushima  Daiichi ) are in what is considered Long Term 
Outage.6 And on 11 March 2015, Japan will be just shy of a year and a half since it has been completely 
nuclear free, with the last remaining reactor powered down on 15 September 2013.  
 
The significance, both domestically and globally, of the third largest nuclear p ower program in the world not 
generating any electricity from its nuclear reactors for nearly 18 months is more than symbolic. It unequivocally 
demonstrates that nuclear energy, contrary to government and power company claims, is not an indispensible  
energ y source.  
 
The reality in Japan is mirrored globally, the disaster accelerating the decades long decline of an already 
outdated and noncompetitive technology.7   
 
However, the powerful vested interests in government, utilities , and industry  – the infamous 'nuclear village' that 
created the conditions that led to the March 2011 Fukushima accident  – are determined to resume nuclear 
reactor operations in Japan.  
 
Globally, the nuclear industry and its advocacy organizations continue to present nu clear power  as a re -
emerging technology that can address the biggest problems facing humanity. Or, as the industry  promotional 
body8, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  states on its site, “Over the past several years, there has

While this may sound quite positive for nuclear power , the reality is far more negative  for the nuclear  industry . 
This brief will provide a candid overview of impact of the Fukushima disaster on the nuclear industry, both within 
Japan and globally.  
 
 
Fukushima Disaster: Impacts in Japan  
The catastrophic nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi  nuclear power plant , which began on 11 March 
2011, not only crippled four of the reactors at the site, but also vividly and tragically illustrated the vulnerabilities 
of Japan’s nuclear power dependency. Heightened awareness of nuclear risks and the problems a ssociated 
with the  nation’s reactors led to the  long-term shut down of all fifty10 of Japan's remaining nuclear reactors.  
 
A massive economic burden has been pla ced on the Japanese government – and ultimately taxpayers – to pay 
the enormous costs for  Fukus hima disaster : in Japan’s budget note for 2014, 652.3 billion JPY  ($6.725 billion 
USD per March 2014 conversion rates)  was listed as the cost solely for reconstruction after the nuclear 
disaster.11 The true cost of the disaster has yet to be calculated, and there are a numbe r of estimates  – one of 
the most accurate estimate s of the economic cost of Fukushima  disaster  at the moment is $169 Billion US 
Dollars, as of February 2013.12 
 
The rapid decline of nuclear power in Japan i n the wake of the disaster  is clear: between 1987 and 2011, 
nuclear accounted for roughly 30% of Japan’s e lectricity  generation.13 On 5 May 2012, Japan’s last operating 
nuclear power plants post -Fukushima were shut down. Only two reactors, Ohi 3 &4, were ever restarted. Both 
were subsequently shut dow n for scheduled maintenance and  restart  was halted  by a court injunction.14 The 
utility, Kansai Electric Power Company (KEPCO), is appealing the verdict , and the NRA has proceeded with 
processing the application – in spite of the injunction against restart that is still en force .  
 
From January until September 2013 – when Ohi 4 was shutdown – nuclear accounted for only 13.6 TWh or 1.6 
percent of total elec tricity. This meager contribution continuing the accelerating downward trend of the 
Japanese nuclear industry, when taken in the context of a historic maximum of 36 percent in 1998, followed by

10 While the number of remaining reactors in the Japanese nuclear fleet after the Fukushima Daiichi  nuclear catastrophe is frequently stated 
to be 48, there were also two reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi site – reactors 5 and 6 – that were not declared to be permanently shut 
down until almost three years after the disaster. TEPCO delayed in making the inevitable shutdown decision until 18 December 2013, 
and only publicly announced these two reactors’ permanent shut down and decommissioning plans on 31 January 2014. Amazingly 
enough, the four units at Fukushima Daini, inside the exclusion zone, 15 km fro m the devastated Fukushima Daiichi, remain officially "in 
operation". After the Daiichi -5 and -6 closures, there are in fact now 48 remaining reactors that are all currently in Long -term Outage. 
Note: the 48 reactor figure is highly conservative, in that i t includes the Daiini reactors which can be considered, for all practical 
purposes, to be shut down – though they have not yet been officially declared so. An additional reactor, the Monju reactor, which has 
been off -line since 1995 but also never official ly closed.

14 On 21 May 2014, a district court judge found in favor of community members seeking an injunction against the restart of the O hi 3&4 
reactors due to the unacceptable risk posed by the reactors to the lives and livelihoods of surrounding community members. The legal 
challenge contended that Kyushu Electric not only underestimated both the seismic and volcano risk, but has also failed to de velop an 
effective evacuation plan for the regions citizens. The judge’s opinion stated that, “It is appropriate that, if  involved in a business 
whereby severe damage would be caused to the lives, health, and livelihood of many people should a serious accident occur, an  
organization should be expected to provide safety and a high degree of reliability in accordance with the size and extent of that damage 
. . . interests relating to the life, body, soul, and lifestyle of an Individual are fundamental to the individuality of each  person, and the 
entirety of these can be considered to be personal rights. Personal rights are ensh rined in the Constitution (Articles 13 and 25), are the 
foundation for people’s lives, and under the laws of our country there are no rights that have greater value. Accordingly, wh en there is a 
risk of a tangible violation of a fundamental aspect of these  personal rights, namely the personal right to protect life and maintain one’s 
lifestyle, a claim can be made for an injunction against violating acts on the basis of these personal rights. Personal right s belong to each 
individual, but when the form of th e violation has the characteristics of simultaneously violating the personal rights of many people, it 
stands to reason that the claim for an injunction there against is strong.” [Note: opinion translated for Greenpeace].

 3 25.8 percent in 201 0.15 For the whole of 2011, nuclear only acc ounted for 9.7 percent. In 2012, nuclear’s share 
further declined to 1.5 percent, followed by 1.3  percent  in 2013 .16 On 15 September 2013, the last reactor  
operating  was shut down. As of 11 March 2015, Japan will have been nearly a year and a half without a  single 
kWh generated by nuclear – and with no blackouts or brownouts17 as a result.

The disaster also galvanized majority public opposition to nuclear energy, as the public turned out in record 
numbers to oppose nuclear power in the ensuing years.19 Four years after the beginning of the Fukushima 
disaster, the majority  of the  public is  still opposed to nuclear restarts.20 Given the successive failures to meet 
declared targets for nuclear restarts21 and significant de lays, the future of nuclear power in Japan is increasingly 
uncertain. It certainly cannot be described as a necessary, reliable, and stable energy source as the Abe 
government has been trying to claim.  
 
 
Aging Reactors: Legally dead?  
In September 2014, the Abe administration asked utilities to decide whether or not to permanently 
decommission the ir oldest reactors. Nuclear power utilities will confirm before the end of March 2015 that they

 4 will permanently close 5 reactors.22 However, m any more are vulnerable to permanent closure, with 7 additional 
reactors nearing 40 years old.  
 
Kansai Electric Power Co. (KEPCO) is particularly challenged with aging reactors ; though it has announced 
plans to seek restart review for  9 of its reactors:  Mihama (39 years) , Ohi 1 (38 years) , Ohi 2 (37 years), 
Takahama 1 (41 years) , and Takahama  2 (40 years) , as well as the Takahama units 3 and 4, which are already 
under review . These will face major challenges technically and politically . It remains highly  uncertain how many 
of these will ever actually be restarted.23 By the end of 2015, four of KEPCO’s reactors will be 40 years old. 
Another three will be at least 35 years old . While the utility may have ambitious restart plans, it is far from certain 
that this will be achievable.  
 
Indicative of the future of Japan’s nuclear fleet, the Japan Atomic Power Co. – a wholly nuclear utility and the 
only one to have experience operating both Boiling Water Reactors ( BWRs ) and Pressurized Water Reactors  
(PWRs ) – anno unced it is considering a major restructuring . In a bid to save its failing business, it is weighing 
whether to unload nuclear operating functions into two smaller companies, and focus its primary business on 
helping other utilities decommission their reac tors.24  
 
The decision to decommission the nation’s oldest reactors would reflect the aging of the reactor fleet in Japan, 
but is also driven at this moment by both politics and economics. The Abe administration is desperate to soften 
or even reverse the ma jority public opinion that remains opposed to any nuclear restart.25 The government is 
clearly hoping this strategy will provide the appearance that it is committed  to nuclear safety and also that it is 
listening to public opinion.  
 
In reality, it is an app easement move of sacrificing reactors that were all but legally dead. For the utilities, 
shutting these reactors down permanently will allow them to avoid the costly investments that would be required 
to attempt to retrofit these old reactors to meet post -Fukushima guidelines – guidelines that still do not 
guarantee safety.26 Conversely, this will also trigger further financial pain for the utilities both in terms of lost 
revenue from future operation and electricity sales, as well as the enormous cost of de commissioning. The 
decision, if implemented, reflects both the strength of public opinion and the continuing uncertainty in future 
reactor operations in Japan.  
 
 
Potential Nuclear Restarts  
A total of 21 nuclear reactors are currently under review by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) for 
compliance with the post -Fukushima disaster guidelines. Kyusyu Electric Power Company’s Sendai units 1 and 
2 reactors in Kagoshima prefecture are the farthest along in the NRA’s review process , though restart is still  
pending final safety reviews and checks.27 Though the restart progression of these two reactors in the review  
process has been touted as the first to meet new, strict safety guidelines, it in  fact has required the NRA to 
accept restart in spite of noncompliance with their own and international nuclear safety standards.28 
 
The Sendai  restart s were originally predicted for summer  2014, then before the end of March 2015, but Kyushu 
Electric  recent ly announced that it may be into the summer before either reactor restarts.29 While the Takahama

 5 reactors 3 and 4 are the next in line for potential NRA approval, their restart is now projected to be the last half 
of 2015.  
 
It is also critically important t o understand that even  purported  compliance with the NRA guidelines and future 
restart approvals do not mean that the Sendai nuclear reactors  or others under review  have been assessed for 
overall nuclear safety. The NRA chair has admitted that, "We cannot say that a disaster will never happen. The 
regulations cannot guarantee safety."30 The approval by the NRA confirms that it believes that the plant 
matches the updated standards but they admit that “the plant’s safety has improved to a certain extent, but t his 
is not the goal.”31 [Bold and Italics added]  
 
The timeframe for restart of nuclear plants, the total number that will be restarted, and the number that will be 
permanently shutdown is impossible to state precisely at this stage. There are multiple varia bles, in addition to 
the on -going NRA review process, such as the  legal challenges  that have been brought or are currently 
underway against all 48 officially still operating nuclear reactors in Japan.  Given the glacially slow restarts, it is 
safe to assume  that the majority of Japan’s nuclear fleet will remain offline for the remainder of 2015.  
 
 
Abe's flawed energy policy  
In April 2014, a new energy plan was approved by the Abe Government. It reversed the previous government's 
position, announced in Septe mber 2012, which called for a zero nuclear power future by the 2030s.32 This new 
Fourth Strategic Energy Plan is the first formal energy policy issued since the Fukushima  Daiichi  accident. It 
describes nuclear power as “low -carbon and quasi -domestic energy” and a “base -load” power source that 
should be used for continuous, around -the-clock power generation.33  The April plan set  no targets  for nuclear 
generation.34 
 
A panel of exper ts set up under the Ministry of  Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)  recently began deliberating 
on setting 2030 targets for energy generation; 15 or 20% for nuclear have been suggested thus far. While even 
these targets are likely wishful thinking, they are  also a far cry from the 50% nuclear generation by 2030 that the 
previous energy plan of 2010 had called for.35 It also, however, reflects the reality that the Government simply 
does not know which, how many, or when any of the currently shutdown reactors will be restarted.  
 
The reality is that every nuclear power plant in Japan has major outstanding safety issues, and the citizens of 
Japan do not trust the assurances of the government or utilities’ claims that these can be operated without risk 
of severe ac cident.  
 
 
The economic failure of nuclear power  
In justifying its support for the restart of the nation’s shutdown nuclear reactors, in spite of the majority public 
opposition post -Fukushima  disaster , the government has emphasized the nation’s growing fiscal trade deficit 
caused in part by the importation of replacement fossil fuel.36 While the trade deficit has grown since 2011, 
recent export increases and lower oil prices leave financial analysts predicting that Japan will return to a trade 
surplus in 2015.37 However, clearly an energy system based on such large imports of fossil fuels neither makes 
sense for the economy or the environment – and Abe's reliance on nuclear power restarts will not solve the 
underlying energy policy crisis.

total deficit, should be seen in the context of deliberate government policy on of the pillars of 'Abeconomics' with the devaluation of the 
yen aimed at boosting exports, but which also has the effect of increasing the cost of imports.

In the first in stance, Abe's policy of yen depreciation has raised the costs of all imports, including fossil fuels. 
Analysis has pointed to the decline of Japan's nuclear utilities pre -dating the Fukushima  Daiichi  accident, in 
particular relative to gas companies.38  By failing to develop major renewable technology, while prioritizing 
nuclear power, successive Japanese governments have developed an energy system heavily dependent on fuel 
importation – and highly vulnerable in the event of a major nuclear accident.  
 
Recent  decisions by Japan’s METI , which  allow utilities to block renewable energy access to the grid,  only 
further exacerbate the fragility of Japan’s energy system and dependency on fossil fuels.39 The new rule 
effectively caps the growth of renewable energy by providing priority grid access to the fossil fuels and nuclear 
energy sources that triggered the current trade deficits and undermine  progress on CO 2 emissions reductions.  
 
 
The Global Impacts of the Fukushima Disaster  
It is critically important to note t hat for decades prior to the Fukushima  Daiichi  accident in March 2011, the 
global nuclear industry  was in decline. While in Japan  the nuclear disaster sparked an abrupt shift away from 
nuclear power, globally it merely accelerated the downward trend.   
 
 
Pre-Fukushima: an industry in decline  
Since the inception of civil nuclear programs  in the 1950s , there have been two major “waves” of nuclear reactor 
grid connections: the first peaked in 1974, and the second wave in the 1984 -85 period.40 By the end of the  
1980s, successive net increases in operating nuclear reactors had ended .41 The year  1990 marked the first time 
since the beginning of the commercial nuclear power industry that nuclear reactor shut downs exceeded 
startups.42 In the decade of 1991 – 2000, re actor shut downs far outweighed reactor start ups, 52:30.43 
Between 2001 and 2010, as many reactors were shut down as were started up, 32:32.  Between 2004 and 
2007, the capacity of the global nuclear fleet dropped by 2 GW annually.44 In 2008 and 2009, capac ity gains 
from “uprating”  – retrofitting old reactors in order to generate more electricity – were offset by plant closures, 
resulting in a net decline in global nuclear capacity.45 
 
In 2009 nuclear generation fell for the third year in a row – generating 4% less energy than in 2006.46 In 2010, 
5.5 GW were added due, in part, to uprating .47  
 
While construction slowed to a trickle and net reactor shutdowns have outweighed net reactor startups since 
1990, the supposed “nuclear renaissance” appeared to be dead on arrival – in spite of massive government 
support via loan guarantees , as well as other direct and indirect subsidies in many countries. In June 2009, 
nearly two years prior to the Fukushima disaster, Moody’s Investor Service summarized the risk associat ed with 
the nuclear construction plans in the nation with the largest nuclear fleet, the United States:  
 
It has now been three decades since the last, serious nuclear construction cycle . . . Historical rating actions have 
been unfavorable for issuers see king to build new nuclear generation. Of 48 issuers that we evaluated during the 
last nuclear building cycle (roughly 1965 -1995), two received rating upgrades, six went unchanged, and 40 had 
downgrades. Moreover, the average downgraded issuer fell four not ches . . . We view new nuclear generation 
plans as a “bet the farm” endeavor for most companies, due to the size of the investment and length of time 
needed to build a nuclear power facility . . . We observe, however, that nuclear projects require massive 
investments, and the long -term recovery of which presents a primary risk factor for issuers actively trying to build 
new nuclear power plants. Historically, in fact, many of the large nuclear utilities experienced some financial distress 
while building the ir plants. Material rating downgrades remain just as distinct a possibility today . . . New nuclear 
power construction appears to enjoy strong political and regulatory support in a number of jurisdictions, especially 
in the southeastern [United] [S]tates, where there is now legislation afoot to promote it . . . Nevertheless, regulatory

 7 risks will persist over the longer term, and we increasingly think it unlikely that everything will work out as intended. 
We are concerned with the size of the investments be ing made even before the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission] grants a COL [Construction and Operating License]; the ongoing potential risks from displacement 
technology developments over the course of the construction period; and the recovery of sizeable s unk costs, 
should an issuer abandon a project in the future. The likelihood that Moody’s will take a more negative rating 
position for most issuers actively seeking to build new nuclear generation is increasing .48 
 
Fitch Ratings expressed similar sentiments  even earlier, in 2006; analysis echoed by Standard and Poor’s, 
which in 2008 declared that for new nuclear construction “risks remain uncertain, but significant.”49 Citigroup 
Global Markets also expressed similar negative views on risky investments for new  nuclear in 2008.50 
 
 
Post-Fukushima  
Although the nuclear industry was already declining for years prior to the Fukushima disaster, and investors 
were already viewing new -build plans as risky , the impact of the 2011 disaster on the global industry was 
significant with the full scale likely to only become apparent in the years ahead.  
 
In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, the global downward trend for nuclear generation accelerated. In 2011 
there was a record drop, with a 4% decrease in nuclear generation. In 2012, this was further compounded with 
a second record drop of 7%.51 While 75% of this decrease was due to the majority of the Japanese nuclear 
fleet being offline, 16 other countries, in cluding the top 5 nuclear generators, saw decreases in their nuclear 
generation.52 
 
 
 
Many countries also chose to either phase out existing nuclear power or rejected previous plans to resurrect civil 
nuclear programs. In 2011, Germany took a major step fo rward in the already ongoing energy transition by  
shutting down eight  reactors  – 7 of its oldest, and Krummel – and announcing a complete nuclear phase -out by 
2022. Switzerland  and Belgium also announced nuclear phase -out plans.53 Sweden followed suit in 20 14, with

 8 a decision to set up an energy commission to phase out nuclear and achieve a 100% renewable energy 
target.54 In the wake of the decision, Sweden’s State -owned utility, Vattenfall, and the federal nuclear regulator, 
SSM, halted all preparations for new nuclear construction.55 
 
 
New Build  
Four countries that had considered reviving nuclear programs, scrapped them as of June 2012, including: Italy, 
Egypt,56 Kuwait, and Thailand .57  
 
Many predicted newcomer nations have had their plans impacted by the Fukushima accident  – delayed, if not 
still on hold – including: Bangladesh, Belarus, Jordan, Turkey, Lithuan ia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam.58  
 
For nearly two years after the Fukushima disaster  began , China froze all nuclear construction. Although it  
currently has the largest number of reactors listed as under construction, the freeze seems to have reigned in 
some of China’s ambition: reports of the 2020 target for nuclear have ranged from 40 GW to 120 GW;59 it now 
seems highly unlikely that the low en d target of 40 GW will be ex ceeded by any significant amount  by 2020.60 
 
Poland is still purportedly moving forward with their 2005 decision to pursue the nuclear option. In 2009, the 
country created a plan to have operating reactors by 2020; the plans were  subsequently updated twice (2011 
and 2013), and have “slipped” at least 3 years.61  
 
In early 2014, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Nguyen Tan Dung, announced that the country would delay 
construction of its first nuclear reactor to 2020 to ensure “safety a nd efficiency.”62  
 
As of June 2014, the World Nuclear Association listed eight potential newcomer countries that had begun 
construction, signed contracts, or committed to nuclear programs.63 Some of these have had plans for new 
build for decades without the m ever being realised.  
 
 
Retrofitting the World’s Aging Reactor F leet 
The impact of post -Fukushima disaster retrofits for older reactors, and the ensuing costs associated with those 
retrofits , vary greatly from country to country. In some countries, such as France and Japan, these retrofits will 
significantly impact the competitiveness of the nuclear fleet.64 France’s Court of Account's estimated in 2012 
that safety upgrades for France ’s 58 reactors could reach a total of €55 billion , of which  an estimated  €10 billion 
was required for post-Fukushima  disaster  retrofits.65 This €55 billion figure is a lmost certainly a significant

56  Under new governance, Egypt has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Russian State nuclear corporation, 
Rosatom. The MOU provides for the potential building of two reactors, with potentially an additional two, and a desalinization facilit y.

58  By July 2013, all newcomer countries listed had delayed nuclear programmes . Subsequently, Bangladesh, Belarus, Turkey, Jordan, and 
Poland are purportedly moving forward with new build plans. Of these, Bangladesh, Belarus, Turkey, and likely Jordan are depe ndent 
upon funding and infrastructure provided by Russia’s state nuclear c orporation, Rosatom. Although Rosatom has an extremely 
aggressive nuclear export strategy, analysts have questioned whether even this state -backed corporation can financially support it. In 
addition to potential financial constraints – and even excluding p otential political, legal, and/or public opposition barriers in each of these 
countries, Rosatom’s own track record of overpromising and under delivering certainly raises questions as to which and how ma ny of 
these programs would be able to move forward, a t least in the framework in which they are now pursued.  For more information on 
Rosatom, see Suppliers section of this briefing (pgs. 10-12).

 9 underestimate of the total cost to the French utility EDF, which could , in reality , range from €2-4 billion per 
reactor  depending on the targeted safety level .66     
 
In most countries , implementation of post -Fukushima  disaster  safety upgrades ha s been unacceptably delayed  
or not even requested .67 Resistance to quickly and full y addressing technical and safety issues highlighted by 
the Fukushima disaster is almost exclusively due to concern for minimizing the financial costs to nuclear 
operators for safety upgrades.  
 
 
Limiting Accident Liability: making the public pay  
In the wake of the Fukushima  catastrophe , the nuclear industry and their allied governments redoubled efforts to 
shore up any gaps in liability laws that could leave suppliers responsible for the risks their technology and 
products create. The nuclear industry, and particularly nuclear suppliers, has  enjoyed significant protection from 
the enormous potential costs of a nuclear disaster in many countries.68 The Convention on Supplementary 
Compensation has been the industry’s vehicle for these post-Fukushima ambitions, and would shield suppliers 
in almost all instances from liability for damages caused by their equipment  and technologies  in the event of a 
catastrophic failure. It also limits the amount of funding available to nuclear victims – as well as liabi lity in the 
event of cross -boundary fallout, as witnessed by Chernobyl.69 In November 2014, Japan passed legislation to 
allow the country to join the CSC.70 In January 2015, it was ratified, which will bring the international treaty into 
force.71  
 
 
Internati onal Regulation: protecting the industry  
Internationally, and with  the regulatory  bar set low, the European Union appeared to be pushing for higher 
nuclear safety standards – but the proposal was still  woefully weak, delayed , and fail ed to ensure the safe  
operation of reactors.72 The two other countries in the world who have themselves or their predecessors 
experienced a partial meltdown or catastrophic nuclear meltdown at civil reactors also led the charge to keep 
international post -Fukushima  disaster  safety standards as weak as possible: the United States and Russia.73  
Reportedly, this wa s due to concern for increasing the economic costs to nuclear utilities.74 
 
Ultimately, the declaration75 passed by the 77 -member nation convention was weaker still than the EU proposal 
– laying out basic principles, but failing to have any force of law.76 And as predicted, t his was due in large part  
to U.S. – Russian  opposition.77 
 
However, with continuing  international and domestic uncertainty  regarding when and how Fuku shima  disaster  
upgrades and design changes will be implemented , it is impossible to predict the full economic impacts of

 10 further post -Fukushima  disaster  safety retrofits both for operating reactors and modifications of newer designs. 
While the industry and  their allied governments are pushing for the weakest possible standards, it is safe to say 
that it will be impossible for the industry to ignore Fukushima  catastrophe , and any retro fit or upgrade further 
exacerbates the economic troubles of an industry wi th a track record78 of significant delays, massive financial  
overruns, and significantly increasing operating costs due to aging related problems.  
 
 
Suppliers  
The global industry has been experiencing the problems of a slowly dying industry for decades: few reactor 
orders have meant manufacturing abilities of reactor components were lost or outsourced  in much of the OECD , 
construction knowledge has atrophied, and human resources are aging without a new generation of nuclear 
engineers and workers ready or willing to take their places.79  
 
Amidst this rather bleak landscape, nuclear suppliers have struggled to maintain a profitable business – and in 
many cases, are trying and failing. Many of the suppliers most aggressively seeking contracts abroad are state -
backed or owned entities such as South Korea’s KEPCO, Russia’s Rosatom, and France’s Areva and EDF.  
 
However, even vested state interest does not mean financial solvency: for example, Areva – one of the largest 
nuclear suppliers globally, with the French State ownership of its shares standing at 87% – is in precarious 
financial straights, and the situation seems to be deteriorating rapidly .80 Post-Fukushima  disaster , the company 
has seen its business atrophy, recording losses for the past three years.81 In No vember 2014, the nuclear giant 
announced that it was suspending its financial outlooks for 2015 and 2016 altogether, citing significant delays in 
its Finnish new build project and a “still lackluster” global nuclear market for its decision.82 In spite of th is move, 
Standard & Poors downgraded Avrea ’s credit rating to BB+, stripping the company of its investment grad status 
and downgrading it to junk.83 In February 2015, according to sources, Areva  is drafting plans to allow EDF, the 
French state -backed utility, a stake in its business.84 The plan reportedly would include joint reactor export and 
fuel reprocessing ventures.85  
 
In order to survive in current markets, some nuclear suppliers are pushing  new drastic schemes to finance new 
reactor construction projects.  
  
For example, EDF’s new build project, Hinkley Point C, in the United Kingdom require s unprecedented 
subsidies at the expense of consumers in order to move forward. In October  2014 , the Eu ropean Commission 
gave the green light to the massive ratepayer recovery scheme, stating that it did not violate EU state aid laws. 
The terms would guarantee EDF £92.50 per megawatt hour, twice the current bulk rate of electricity, for a 35 
year period.86 Consumer advocacy groups say the move could add as much as £5 billion a year to consumers’ 
bills.87  
 
The European Commission’s  decision will be challenged by the Government of Austria , which will further 
undermine the prospects for this nuclear project, inc luding investment decisions over the next several years .88 
 
Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear state corporation, has touted aggressive goals for both domestic and foreign 
expansion. However, a careful analysis of this State entity’s track record reveals significant  delays, inflated new

 11 build figures, consecutive downward revision of targets, and troubling safety and quality control issues.89 
 
In an effort to boost nuclear exports and entice new orders, Rosatom has increasingly been pushing its Build, 
Own, Operate” or  “BOO” model which offers to finance, build, and operate reactors abroad. Rosatom recently 
expanded its export focus from countries with smaller programs that were aiming to scale up their capacity 
(India, China, and South Africa), to both established nucl ear nations (Finland, Hungary, and the UK) as well as 
completely newcomer nations (Vietnam, Belarus, Bangladesh , Jordan, Egypt  and Turkey). Under this scheme, 
Rosatom projects that it will have orders for 80 reactors abroad by 2030.90 However, financial ana lysts have 
raised doubts about the economic feasibility of such ambitions, suggesting that it would be difficult for Rosatom 
to financially support so many expensive nuclear projects – even with state funding.91 
 
As Nadira Barkatullah , a former International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) economist, stated, “Equity 
investment by vendors is the new emerging trend based on market conditions post -financial crisis. But it is not 
feasible for one vendor to take on a lot of projects."92 
 
These i nflated ambitions, the company’s track record, and the general flagging interest, and financial challenges 
of the industry as a whole certainly raise  doubts about the ability of  Rosatom to deliver on its targets and its 
contracts.  
 
 
Conclusion  
The impact of the catastrophic TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi disaster on the nuclear industry, both in Japan and 
internationally, has been significant. And in many ways, the full effects are yet to be seen.  
Like Chernobyl two and a half decades before, t he Fukushima  Daiichi  disaster yet again highlight s the enormous 
human and environmental costs of a nuclear catastrophe within the global arena. And, it also publicly exposed 
both the devastating economic consequence s – with the bill estimated in 2013 at $169  billion USD , with 
decades of continuing work ahead – as well as the major  vulnerabilities of nuclear reactors.  
 
In contrast, r enewables are already outcompeting nuclear in international markets, being modern technology 
and faster, cheaper, and significantly  less risky – economically, environmentally, and for communities – than 
nuclear.  
 
Yet, the nuclear industry will certainly not go quietly into the pages of history, where it belongs. Since its 
inception, it has enjoyed unprecedented levels of government p rotection, indemnification, R&D funding, direct 
and indirect subsidies, and vast amounts of consumer dollars. As we have seen in the past four years, the 
industry is fighting for its survival, meaning it is desperate to weaken regulations , shore -up liabili ty “gaps,” and 
take full advantage of consumers’ and taxpayers’ money, if governments and regulators permit it.  
 
All of these nuclear industry efforts place the public at risk: financially, as well as safety. Nuclear power also 
stands in the way of the rapid renewable energy transition needed to address energy service security issues and 
climate change by sucking up vast amounts of government and consumer funds and limiting the amount of 
room on the grid available for these modern  technologies – effectively capping them.  
 
One of the ultimate  lesson s of the Fukushima  catastrophe  is that nuclear  power  is not safe, it is not cheap, and 
when it fails, the results can be devastating . With today’s safer, quicker , low-carbon techno logies, there is no 
reason to accept nuclear costs or nuclear risks.  
 
Some facts are very clear, however : In Japan, nuclear power’s return to pre -Fukushima  disaster  levels already 
looks impossible.  Globally, the industry will continue to decline.   
 
The qu estion that remains is whether nuclear will be able to hang on long enough to severely hinder 
decentralized and local renewable development, stymieing meaningful action to address climate change, while 
putting communities across the planet at unnecessary f inancial and safety risk.
