Greenpeace US would like to dedicate this report to those individuals at the U.S.Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) who have attempted to regulate reactors and reduce the risks they pose to public health and safety. These individuals have risked their careers by speaking truth to power inside the NRC and informing the public of the risks posed by nuclear power plants.

Thirty years after Chernobyl and five years after the triple meltdown at Fukushima 
Daiichi in Japan, U.S. nuclear regulators are claiming that U.S. nuclear power plants are safe and that Fukushima couldn’t happen here. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Contrary to these claims, Greenpeace has documented 166 near misses or acci-
dent precursors at US nuclear power plants over the past decade that risk analysts have determined are precursors to a meltdown.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Com-mission (NRC) documented 61 events and 102 conditions at US nuclear plants that  
were near misses to a meltdown. 
Unfortunately, NRC’s Accident Sequence Precursor program missed three of the 
most risk significant near misses in the past decade; the triple meltdown thr eat to 
Duke Energy’s Oconee Nuclear Station in South Carolina. According to NRC’s risk analysts, if Jocassee Dam failed all three of the nuclear reactors at Oconee were certain to meltdown.  And contrary to the claims of the Nuclear Regulatory Commis -
sion, the threat to the Oconee reactors was hundreds of times more probable than the tsunami that struck Japan in 2011. The NRC considers ten of these near misses to be important precursors to a core melt accident.        Executive SummaryNuclear Near Misses:

IMPORTANT NEAR MISSES AT U.S. REACTORS 2004 - 2014

The three reactors at Duke Energy’s 
Oconee nuclear plant weren’t the only ones that were at risk from flooding.  The NRC has documented over a dozen other nuclear reactors that were threat-ened by flooding over the past decade.  Many of these near miss vulnerabilities dated back decades and were only iden-tified after the NRC was forced to take a closer look at U.S. nuclear plants in the aftermath of Fukushima.  In addition to the flooding vulnerabilities, NRC risk analysts identified a statistically signifi-cant trend in Losses of Offsite Power or (LOOPs) at US nuclear plants. This trend is a result of 20 LOOP events in just the last four years.
Equally as disturbing as the 166 accident 
precursors or near misses is the fact that NRC staff has had to turn whistleblow-er on four of the top ten near misses in order to get the agency to address the risks in a timely manner.  
Contrary to the claims of U.S. regulators 
and the nuclear industry, nuclear pow-er plants can experience catastrophic failures like those we witnessed at Fuk-ushima Daiichi in Japan.  This probabil-ity makes nuclear power anything but “safe”. The NRC’s failure to make public the documents that revealed the flood-ing threat to all three reactors at Duke Energy’s Oconee Nuclear Station has only served to significantly delay the final resolution of nuclear near misses that are even more risk significant than those that caused the fiasco at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan.  The NRC’s failure to address long standing safety issues at Oconee and other U.S. nuclear plants further serves to undermine public confidence in nuclear power and those that regulate it.  
Greenpeace US’ report on Nuclear Near 
Misses finds that despite years of in-spections, licensing and relicensing, safety issues continue to be identified at U.S. reactors; many of which date back decades, some vulnerabilities have ex-isted since the nuclear plants were first started.  These long standing vulnerabil-ities make nuclear power anything but safe. Greenpeace has long called for the phase out of nuclear power and this re-port further supports that determination.

Ten years ago, Greenpeace published 
our report American Chernobyl: Nuclear Near Misses at U.S. Reactors Since 1986 to remind the public and government officials that contrary to the claims made by the nuclear industry lobbyists and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Chairman and Commissioners:
 *U.S. reactors can have acci-
dents with consequences equal to or 
greater than the Chernobyl disaster;
 *U.S. reactors have had and will 
continue to experience “near misses” 
that could result in a meltdown;
 *U.S. reactor containments were 
not designed to withstand a reactor 
meltdown and the government has lit-tle confidence that any of them could.
Now, thirty years after Chernobyl and 
five years after the meltdown of three General Electric-designed nuclear reac-tors
1  at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
plant in Japan, U.S. NRC Commission-ers are again claiming that U.S. reactors are “safe” and that “Fukushima couldn't happen here.”

Despite blithe assurances from the NRC 
 Introduction
Commissioners since the Fukushima fiasco, that “(t)he NRC continues to de-termine that US nuclear plants are safe,”
3  
Greenpeace’s review of a decade of nuclear near misses shows that US reac-tors are still vulnerable to both flooding and losses of off-site power as well as other vulnerabilities to a meltdown that make them anything but “safe.”
NRC risk analysts have documented 
163 events or conditions at U.S. nucle-ar power plants in the last decade that could have resulted in a meltdown. In addition to these 163 accident precur -
sors or near misses identified by the NRC, Greenpeace has documented three important near misses that NRC risk analysts failed to review under the NRC’s Accident Sequence Precursor Program (ASP).
After Fukushima the nuclear industry and 
its regulators have been forced to reex-amine the holes in the nation’s nuclear safety net
4.   But as former NRC Chair -
man Gregory Jaczko noted “unfortunate-ly, all too often, when faced with tough policy calls, a majority of this current commission has taken an approach that is not as protective of public health and safety as I believe is necessary.”

In order to compile the last decade of 
nuclear near misses Greenpeace re-viewed the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) program for track-ing and evaluating near misses or as the agency terms them “precursors to severe core damage accidents” or “ac-cident precursors.” Accident precursors are those actual events or conditions at nuclear reactors that if additional failures had occurred, would have resulted in in-adequate cooling of the radioactive fuel and caused it to meltdown.
6  The NRC 
analyses inspection reports and licensee event reports submitted by the nuclear plant operators to capture those events or conditions that could have led to a meltdown.  
For the purpose of analyzing risk, the 
NRC divides nuclear reactor risks into two categories: initiating events and degraded conditions.
7  Initiating events 
are actual occurrences such as a loss of offsite power (LOOP) or an automat-ic or manual shutdown (SCRAM) of the reactor with complications like any addi-tional equipment failures or degradation of safety system function.
8  Degraded 
conditions are those recognized safety system or equipment degradations or unavailability that came to light without an occurrence of an initiating event.
9  
 Nuclear Near Misses 
To analyze initiating events, the NRC cal-culates a conditional core damage prob-ability or CCDP . CCDP represents the probability that the nuclear reactor would experience core damage or a meltdown of the radioactive fuel rods, given an oc-currence of the initiating event and any subsequent equipment failure or degra-dation.
10 
To analyze degraded conditions, the NRC calculates the increase in core damage probability or CDP . CDP repre-sents the increase in the probability that the reactor would damage the core for the period that safety equipment was un-available or incapable or performing its function. 
11  
Once the NRC has assessed an event, they determine the probability that it could have led to a meltdown.  The NRC’s Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) program uses CCDP and CDP interchangeably and uses scientific no-tation to describe the significance.  For example Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima the core damage proba-bility was 1 in 1.  Nuclear Near Misses: 
A Decade of Accident Precursors at U.S. NuclearPlants                                                                                    Greenpeace                                                                       

10
For those accidents that did not result in 
core damage the NRC assess a proba-bility expressed as a negative function. For example:
1 X 10-1  = 1/10;
1 X 10-2  = 1/100;
1 X 10-3  = 1/1,000,
1 X 10-4 = 1/10,000,
1 X 10-5 = 1/100,000
1 X 10-6 = 1/1,000,000 
12
For the purposes of assessing reactor 
risk the NRC breaks the events into cat-egories based upon their perceived sig-nificance.  According to NRC, accident precursors with a Conditional Core Dam-age Probability or CCDP or CDP of 1 in 1000 are considered significant, accident precursors with a CCDP of 1 in 10,000 are considered important and those with a CCDP of greater than 1 in a million are consider precursors.

Terminology & Methodology

11
In the aftermath of the triple meltdown at 
Fukushima, many, including Greenpeace,  have questioned the validity and useful-ness of nuclear risk assessments.  The nuclear industry’s claims regarding the risk of melting down a nuclear reactor do not stand up in the face of the historic record.   
As Princeton’s MV Ramana pointed out 
in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists: 
“The lesson from the Fukushima, 
Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island ac-cidents is simply that nuclear power comes with the inevitability of cata-strophic accidents. While these may not be frequent in an absolute sense, there are good reasons to believe that they will be far more frequent than quantitative tools such as probabilistic risk assessments predict.”
16
To claim that nuclear power is safe is little more than atomic hubris. Nuclear power plants will fail, and when they do, the consequences are catastrophic for individuals and society. As the co-dis-coverer of the DNA molecule once put it, "the idea that the atom is safe is just a public relations trick."  
17
Fukushima has also reminded us that probability will not protect the public

Nuclear Power Plant Risk 
when a nuclear reactor melts down. 
Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book The Black Swan addressed the impact of low-prob-ability, high-consequence events such as Fukushima and he points out the psy-chological trap of relying on probability to protect us.  As Taleb stated after Fuk-ushima: 
“I spent the last two decades explain-
ing … why we should not talk about small probabilities in any domain. Science cannot deal with them. It is irresponsible to talk about small probabilities and make people rely on them, except for natural systems that have been standing for 3 billion years (not manmade ones for which the probabilities are derived theoretical-ly, such as the nuclear field for which the effective track record is only 60 years).”
18 
Probability provides cold comfort when reactors are overwhelmed by forces they were never designed to resist—such as the meltdown of the radioactive fuel rods that make up the core of the nuclear re-actor.  As John Downer points out in his article, “Disowning Fukushima”, “What is the purpose of a risk calculation of dubious reliability? It is not useful to say that there is a one on a million chance of a meltdown but an unknowable but nonetheless meaningful chance that that figure is completely wrong …?”  
19

12
As Downer states, “The only fact that 
Fukushima demonstrates absolutely unambiguously is that devastating over -
sights can exist in what authoritative experts ardently claim to be rigorous, objective and conservative risk calcula-tions.” 
20While nuclear risk assessment 
calculations cannot and should not be taken as gospel, the NRC’s Accident Sequence Precursor program could pro-vide useful insights into the gaps in the regulator’s approach to preventing melt-downs.  As Price Waterhouse Coopers wrote after Fukushima:
“The U.S. nuclear industry must en-
hance its risk management capabilities in two ways. First, it must strengthen existing risk assessment methodologies to address extremely low-probability, high-consequence risks. This will involve  
improving existing processes and tools to identify potential risks from a much   wider range of uncertainties than the industry has used in the past. Traditional  thinking about “known unknowns” must be expanded to include “unknown   unknowns.” 
21
However, contrary to the PWC’s recom-mendation the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has ceased to include and acknowledge those potentially risk sig-nificant events or conditions that are not modeled in their assessments.  The last time NRC acknowledged the blind spot in their nuclear power plant risk models 
was the year BEFORE Fukushima.
22
From 2001- 2009, “30 percent of the 
identified precursors involved initiators or failure cases were not explicitly modeled in the associated SPAR (Standardized Plant Analysis Risk) model.”
23  The near 
misses NRC failed to model that are in-cluded in this report are contained in the appendix. 
As Yale University Professor Emeritus 
and renowned accident expert Charles Perrow pointed out in the wake of Fuk-ushima, “it is important to ask whether some industrial systems have such huge catastrophic potential that they should not be allowed to exist.”
24   One of many 
reasons Greenpeace has long called for the phase out of nuclear power in the US and around the planet.Risk After Fukushima

In compiling the last decade of nucle-
ar near misses at US nuclear plants, Greenpeace has reviewed the U.S. Nu-clear Regulatory Commission Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) reports from 2005 - 2015. The NRC’s analysis of risk significant events and conditions at US reactors involves the review of hundreds of potential precursors and this takes time. So the NRC reports released in 2015 cover near misses from 2014. After reviewing a decade of nuclear near miss-es, Greenpeace has found the good, the bad and the ugly in the NRC’s assess-ment of reactor risk and it’s regulation of US nuclear plants.
The Good: There has not been a sig-
nificant near miss since the 2002 Davis Besse debacle. The reactor vessel head degradation at Davis Besse in Ohio is still the most risk significant near miss since the meltdown at Three Mile Island.
25
The Bad: Despite NRC’s claims that US nuclear plants are “safe,” US reactors have experienced 166 near miss events or conditions that were so risk significant that government regulators considered them “precursors” to a meltdown. The NRC’s Accident Sequence Precursor program identified 61 events and over 100 conditions at US nuclear plants that

could have led to a meltdown; NRC con-sidered seven of these to be “important” precursors. However, the NRC’s  ASP program failed to capture three of the most risk significant conditions over the past decade; the triple meltdown threat to Duke Energy’s Oconee Nuclear Sta-tion, 30 miles west of Greenville South Carolina. While the NRC ASP program failed to review the flood risk at Oconee, NRC’s risk analysts did identify a sta-tistically significant increase in Loss Of Off-site Power (LOOPs) events over the last decade due to 20 such events in the past four years.
The Ugly: After Fukushima, NRC com-
missioners testified to Congress that U.S. nuclear plants were “safe” and that a Fukushima couldn’t occur in the United States. However, NRC commissioners and staff were aware as early as May of 2008 that Duke Energy had failed to pro-vide “adequate protection” from flooding risks at Duke Energy’s Oconee Nucle-ar Station. The NRC was aware that should the Jocassee dam just 10 miles up stream fail, all three Oconee nuclear reactors were certain to melt down.
26  
Despite this knowledge it took NRC until June 2010 to require Duke to install tem-porary mitigation measures.
27  As of April 
2016 permanent flooding fixes to the Oconee site are still not competed. 

15
Almost as disturbing as the Oconee near misses is the fact that NRC staff has had 
to blow the whistle and go public on four of the near misses in or der to force the 
agency to address long standing safety issues at US nuclear plants. While not as risk significant as the triple meltdown threat at Oconee, the NRC staff has also iden-tified flooding vulnerabilities at over a dozen reactors that were risky enough to be considered accident precursors or near misses. Despite licensing and relicensing these nuclear reactors, the NRC only caught these flooding vulnerabilities AFTER the triple meltdown at Fukushima forced regulators to take a closer look.
Important Near Misses at US Nuclear Plants28
Table 1

16
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s Accident Sequence Precursor Program 
considers any event or condition with a risk equal to or above 1 in 10,000 as an “im -
portant” precursor to a core damage accident.29   Over the past decade, there have 
been ten such event or conditions that Greenpeace has documented above.  Unfor -
tunately, three of the most risk significant findings in the past decade were not cap-tured by NRC’s ASP program; the triple meltdown threat at Duke Energy’s Oconee Nuclear Station.
The triple meltdown threat at Duke Energy’s Oconee nuclear power plant in South 
Carolina only became public after the triple meltdown at Fukushima when NRC safety advocates blew the whistle over NRC and Duke Energy’s failure to mitigate the threat in a timely manner.
30  According to NRC risk analysts:
“The probability of Jocassee Dam catastrophically failing is hundreds of times greater than a 51 foot wall of water hitting Fukushima Daiichi and, like the  tsunami in Japan, the man‐made ‘tsunami’ resulting from the failure of the  Jocassee Dam will –- with absolute certainty –- result in the failure of three re-actor plants along with their containment structures.”
31 
Unfortunately, the triple meltdown threat at Oconee isn't the only important precur -
sor that has caused NRC staff members to risk their careers and turn whistleblower. In March 2016, seven NRC engineers filed a public petition to force the agency to enforce it’s own regulations at Exelon’s Byron plant. 
32 
According to the engineers’ petition: 
“A design flaw in the electric power systems of all but one of the 100 U.S. nu -
clear plants. The flaw prevents the detection of certain disruptions on power 
lines connected to the plants. If a degraded power line were called into service during an emergency, the reactor's motors, pumps and valves could burn out, preventing a safe shutdown.”
33 

17
The NRC engineers point to the fact that this important accident pr ecursor at Byron 
has occurred thirteen times in the past 14 years. The petition states that in February 
of 2013,  “the staff determined that all nuclear facilities are susceptible to this design vulnerability except one plant and recommended that NRC takes prompt regulatory action.”  
34
The fact that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s own engineers have had to re-peatedly break ranks and go public on four of the ten most risk significant events in the past decade reveals serious safety culture issues inside the NRC and the extent to which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is captured by the industry it claims to regulate.
35 
(NOTE: Since Greenpeace first released our compilation of nuclear near misses, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has conducted an annual review of accident precursors. For detailed descriptions of many of the near misses mentioned in this report see UCS’ annual reports.
36  All events and conditions considered accident 
precursors or nuclear near misses in the last decade are listed in the appendix.) 


18
Unfortunately, the three reactors at Duke Energy’s Oconee Nuclear Station wer -
en't the only nuclear reactors that were threatened by flooding. While the threat 
to Oconee certainly posed the greatest risk, NRC’s Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) program identified flooding risks at over a dozen other reactors that were so severe they made NRC’s cut as an accident precursor or “near miss”. While NRC’s ASP program captured these vulnerabilities, it fails to address why the NRC or the nuclear corporations they license failed to identify these long standing safety issues.

19Near Misses at US Nuclear 
Plants: Loss of Offsite Power
The NRC and the nuclear industry only captured the majority of flooding vulnera-
bilities AFTER the triple meltdown at Fukushima forced the agency to take a closer look. These long standing vulnerabilities to flooding represent holes in NRC safety net and call into question the caliber and quality of NRC’s licensing and relicensing schemes. How can major safety flaws go undetected through not one but two li-censing processes and decades of NRC inspections? 


20
As the world witnessed at Fukushima, the loss of offsite power to cool the radioac -
tive fuel can lead to a meltdown with devastating consequences. The NRC’ s web 
site states that, “the availability of ac power to commercial nuclear power plants is 
essential for safe operations and accident recovery. A loss of offsite power (LOOP) event, therefore, is considered an important contributor to total risk at nuclear power plants.” 
37 
The NRC Accident Sequence Precursor program identified a statistically significant increase in Loss of Offsite Power near misses at US reactors. This increase is due to the occurrence of 20 losses of off site power in just the last 4 years.
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has long recognized that: Loss of offsite power (LOOP) can have a major negative impact on a power
 plant’s ability to achieve and maintain safe shutdown conditions. Risk analyses
 suggest that loss of all alternating current power contributes over 70% of   
 the overall risk at some U.S. nuclear plants.
38 
 
According to NRC, typically all loss of off site power events are risky enough to be considered accident precursors or near misses.
39 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   40

Greenpeace’s analysis of the U.S. Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission’s accident sequence precursors or near misses over the past decade reveals that three of the most risk significant conditions discovered by NRC regulators over the past ten years never made it into the NRC accident sequence precursor pro-gram.  As the chart of Important near misses reveals, only five near misses in the past decade posed more risk than the triple meltdown threat to Duke Ener -
gy’s Oconee nuclear power plant.    According to NRC’s risk analysis the NRC’s Missing Near Misses
threat to the three reactors at Oconee from flooding caused by failure of Jocas-see dam was 2.8 X 10-4.
41   This level 
of risk makes the threat an important precursor that should have been cap-tured by the NRC’s Accident Sequence Precursor program and detailed in the reports NRC issues on an annual basis. The graphic below, only publicly released by the NRC under the Freedom of Infor -
mation Act, shows the flooding risk at the Oconee nuclear plant compared to the other threats to the nuclear plant that the NRC requires Duke Energy to defend against.  Nuclear Near Misses:

transparent manner,”42   the agency has been anything but open and transparent 
when dealing with the triple meltdown threat at the Oconee nuclear power plant. In 
fact, the NRC has attempted to withhold information concerning this long standing safety issue by claiming the flooding threat was a security issue.  The NRC repeat-edly stamped documents:
Limited Internal Distribution Permitted
Official Use Only - Security-Related Information
However according to a September 2012 letter from a NRC Reliability Risk Engineer 
to then NRC Chairman Alison McFarlane:
“There is nothing in the letter which is classified with regard to national securi-
ty. There is nothing in the letter which is Safeguards. There is no discussion in the letter about any security related topics. In fact, an electronic word search of the letter only finds the word "security" in the "Security-Related Informa-tion"markings.
Why is this document for "Official Use Only"? Why is it "Security-Related Info r-
mation"? Why is only "Limited Internal Distribution Permitted"? I see nothing in 
the 2008-08-15 letter from NRR/DORL to Duke Energy which prevents it from being released to the public. Is "transparency" still something we've commit-ted to?”
43
The NRC even withheld the letter cited above until the NRC Risk Engineer sued the agency for its release.
44  As documents released to Greenpeace under the Freedom 
Of Information Act detail, Duke Energy & the NRC failed to provide adequate pro-tection against flooding since the plant was licensed. The NRC only began to r ealize 
this in 2006, when of the flooding vulnerability of Oconee’s safe shutdown facility made NRC risk analysts take a harder look.
45   If Jocassee dam fails, all three nucle-
ar reactors at Oconee will meltdown; basically a Fukushima in South Carolina.46  

23
The NRC’s report on flooding risks that 
Greenpeace provided to Huffington Post indicates that:
“The predicted flood would reach 
(Oconee Nuclear Station) in approxi-mately 5 hours …The Failure scenario results are predicted such that core damage occurs  in about 8 to 9 hours following the dam break and contain-ment failure in 59 to 68 hours. When containment failure occurs, significant dose to the public would result.”
47 
But rather than order the shut down of the nuclear plant until flooding defenses were in place, NRC entered into negotia-tions with Duke Energy to justify contin-ued operation. 
As the Oconee Timeline
48  reveals, the 
NRC staff struggled to get NRC senior 
management to address the flood threat in a timely manner. NRC staff was con-cerned that forcing Duke Energy to fix the long standing vulnerability would be an admission of NRC’s “guilt”. The timeline also reveals that NRC Commis-sioners and their technical assistants were repeatedly briefed on the lack of adequate protection at the Oconee nu-clear plant. Despite the recognized threat it took NRC years to order Duke Energy to install temporary flooding mitigation at Oconee.

Excerpts from the seventeen page “Oconee Timeline,”49  only released to Green-
peace through a 2012 Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) request, reveal a dis-
turbing pattern of regulatory inaction. The Oconee Timeline details the negotiations between Duke Energy & NRC from March 2008 - May 2009:
3/19/08 Duke Energy removed references to the SSF(Safe Shutdown Facility) 
wall   wall and Jocassee Dam rupture from the FSAR (Final Safety Analysis 
Report)  Report) via NRC’s 50.59 process.
4/10/08 NRC senior managment (Jack Grobe) wanted a full backfit analysis,   
          “given Duke’s record of fighting NRC.” 
4/29/08  NRC staff was concerned that forcing Duke to fix the flooding issue via a  
  backfit was an admission of guilt 
5/21/08 NRC Senior management (Jack Grobe) felt NRC “did not have an   
  adequate protection argument” but “couldn’t define adequate    
          protection.”
6/11/08  Duke claimed that the flooding threat was incorrectly added to the FSAR  
  (Final Safety Analysis Report) so they felt they could remove it.
8/4/08 Questions from Ed Williamson on acceptance of Oconee’s license    
          renewal application (it turns out we lack grounds to rescind granting  
                   their license renewal) 
8/6/08                          NSIR (Nuclear Security & Incident Response) classified a  meeting on   Oconee      
flood risk as SGI (safeguards information) & had to hang  up onNRC region II Vic McCree. 8/12/08 NSIR determined that this is not SGI based on several reasons, one of  
  which was the potential (radioactive) release exceeding 10 CFR 100   
          guidelines. Can classify as OUO -SRI (official use only - security r elated  
  information)8/6/08 NSIR(Nuclear Security & Incident Response) classified a  meeting on 
Oconee flood risk as SGI (safeguards information) & had to hang  up onNRC region II Vic McCree. 

25
8/12/08      NRC Commissioners Technical Assistants were brief on August 12. 
2008.          2008.
8/13/08 NRC Commissioner Svinicki had questions concerning NRC’s 50.54 (f)  
  (demand for information) letter to Duke Energy on August 13, 2008 and  
  NRC staff prepared an Oconee timeline for Commissioner Svinicki the  
  following day.  
8/20/08      NRC considered issuing a Confirmatory Action Letter (CAL) to Duke as  
          early as August of 2008. (CAL was only issued to Duke on June 22, 
2010)          2010)
8/20/08      NRC staff discussed briefing Congress & need to summarize Oconee for  
  Oversight Staffers. 
8/27/08  NRC senior management (Jack Grobe) “expressed a desire to soften the  
  message to Duke.” 
 
9/10/08  NRC contact to Senator Boxer’s Office regarding why NRC did not order  
  Oconee to shut down. 
10/6/08 Briefing of NRC senior management “Eric Leeds is set for 10/16/08 with  
  I'm briefing the Chairman on 10/17/08. 
10/30/08  NRC senior management (Jack Grobe) “suggested a 6-year allowance to  
  Duke to operate with this vulnerability with a renewal period.”  
12/23/08 Duke claimed inundation levels might exceed 9 feet. 
2/3/09 Commissioner Lyons visit to Oconee and Jocassee sites.
3/6/09 DRA (Division of Risk Assessment) reviewed timeline Jack Grobe   
  prepared for commissioners during the RIC.

26
5/11/08 Meeting at Duke HQ: Jack Grobe reiterated the NRC position that this is  
  an adequate protection issue not a PRA issue. Duke argued that NRC in  
  the past did not cite Yankee Rowe on not having adequate protection  
  against failure of the Harriman Dam as precedent.50 
According to NRC documents released to Greenpeace under FOIA, the NRC had 
prepared a communications plan to to explain to the media, “Why did the Oconee flood issue take so many years to address?”
51   NRC wanted the permanent fixes 
to the flooding vulnerabilities at Oconee completed by February 2016. Duke Ener gy 
wanted to put off permanent mitigation measures until February 2019.52  As of April 
2016, almost a decade after NRC first discovered the triple meltdown threat, perma-nent flooding fixes to protect Duke’s Oconee nuclear plant are still not completed.

Despite the fact that several NRC Commissioners and their technical assistants had 
been briefed on the threat to Duke’s Oconee nuclear power plant in 2008.  The NRC testified to Congress that Fukushima couldn't happen here and claimed that US nu-clear plants were “safe”. 
On March 15, 2012, the Senate Environment and Public Works committee conduct-
ed a hearing on nuclear safety one year after Fukushima. Senator John Barrasso (R -
WY) cited a Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report that concluded Fukushima could happen here and asked the NRC’s Commissioners if they agreed:
“Commissioner Magwood: I think that our infrastructure, our regulatory ap-
proach,our practices at plants, our equipment, our configuration, our design bases would prevent Fukushima from occurring under similar circumstances at a U.S. plant. I ust don’t think it would happen.
Commissioner Svinicki: I agree with my colleagues.Commissioner Apostolakis: I disagree with the statements from UCS. 
I don’t think that what happened in Fukushima can happen here.Commissioner Ostendorff: I also disagree with the UCS report.”
53 
While only Commissioners Svinicki & Jaczko were on the Commission in the 2008-2009 time frame covered by the Oconee Timeline, Commissioners Magwood, Apostolakis & Ostendorff all served on the Commission at the time NRC sent the Confirmatory Action Letter to Duke Energy in June of 2010.
54   Each of these three 
commissioners also visited both Oconee and Jocassee dam and were briefed in 2010.  
55
According to the NRC’s Inspector General, the NRC knew about the triple meltdown threat at Oconee since at least 2008:
“Based on these concerns, the NRC issued a 10 CFR 50.54 (f) letter in August  
2008 requesting information from Duke. Duke responded in September 2008 and after review the NRC found that Duke did not demonstrate that ONS  (Oconee Nuclear Station) would be adequately protected from external flooing events.”
56  Did the NRC mislead Congress?  Nuclear Near Misses: 
A Decade of Accident Precursors at U.S. NuclearPlants                                                                                    Greenpeace                                                                       

29
While the NRC briefed Senate Oversight staff in 2008 to explain why the Commis -
sion had failed to required the shutdown of the Oconee reactors until the threat had 
been mitigated, the NRC never publicly acknowledge that if Jocassee dam failed a ll 
three Oconee reactors were certain to melt down. Instead, NRC wrapped the known vulnerability in security clearances and failed to make public the documents that determined that the NRC had failed to meet its statutory duty to adequately pr otect 
the public.  The 50.54 (f) letter demanding information from Duke Energy, Duke’s response, even the NRC’s confirmatory action letter to force Duke to install tempo-rary mitigation of the triple meltdown vulnerability, were only made public under the Freedom of Information Act after NRC whistleblowers broke the story in the press.
57  
Contrary to the claims made by the four NRC’s Commissioners in Senate testimo-ny, the flooding vulnerabilities at Duke’s Oconee Nuclear Station were actually more significant than the risks that resulted in the triple meltdown at Fukushima. In fact, the threat to all three Oconee reactors was hundreds of times more probable than the tsunami that struck Japan and caused the Fukushima meltdowns. 
58 
As NRC’s risk analysts related to Huffington Post:
“The Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff may be motivated to prevent the  
disclosure of this safety information to the public because it will embarrass the agency. The redacted information includes discussion of, and excerpts from,  NRC official agency records that show the NRC has been in possession of  relevant, notable, and derogatory safety information for an extended period but failed to properly act on it. Concurrently, the NRC concealed the information from the public.”
59 
After reviewing thousands of pages of NRC documents released under FOIA over the past three years, Greenpeace concurs with this conclusion.  The NRC’s failure to make public the documents that revealed the threat to all three reactors at Duke Energy’s Oconee Nuclear Station has only served to significantly delay the final resolution of nuclear near misses that are even more risk significant than those that caused the fiasco at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan. 

30
Greenpeace’s compilation and review of nuclear near misses at US nuclear plants 
over the last decade found over 160 events or conditions that wer e so risk signif-
icant that the US regulators consider them precursors to a core melt accident or melt down. Contrary to the claims made by NRC Commissioners these risks make  
nuclear power anything but “safe”. Ten of these near misses were considered im-portant precursors yet NRC staff had to blow the whistle and go public on four of the top ten near misses in order to force the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to address long standing vulnerabilities and safety issues at US nuclear plants.
Despite the fact that NRC Commissioners testified to Congress that “Fukushima 
couldn’t happen here,” NRC’s own data revealed flooding vulnerabilities at reactors that had existed for years sometime decades but were only identified AFTER the triple meltdown in Japan.  Contrary to NRC testimony to Congress, the NRC was aware of the triple meltdown threat to Duke Energy’s Oconee nuclear station as ear -
ly as 2006. By 2008 the NRC Commissioners and was aware that Duke Energy had failed to provide “adequate protection of the public health and safety,” at Oconee Nuclear Station. However, NRC allowed the nuclear plant to continue to operate for another two years before requiring temporary mitigation measures be put in place. NRC hid the triple meltdown threat from the public claiming security concerns. However NRC whistleblowers contend and FOIA documents released to Green-peace support their contention that NRC’s withheld safety information to avoid em-barrassment. This only served to delay final resolution of a long standing triple melt down threat that was hundreds of times more probable than the events that led to Fukushima.  As of April 2016, nearly a decade after NRC first discover ed the flood-
ing threat at Oconee, Duke Energy still has not completed the permanent flood miti-gation measures to prevent a Fukushima in South Carolina.
Unfortunately, Duke Energy’s Oconee nuclear plant wasn’t the only one to be threat-
ened by flooding. Over a dozen other nuclear plants had similar vulnerabilities some that dated back decades. Yet the NRC only discovered these long standing flooding vulnerabilities at US nuclear plants after the tragedy at Fukushima for ced the agen-
cy to take a closer look.  By failing to act upon known safety vulnerabilities at US nuclear plants the NRC has only served to further undermined public confidence in  
government and it’s regulation of this most unforgiving technology.  Conclusion  Nuclear Near Misses:
