The Making of an Echo Chamber: How the plastic industry exploited anxiety
about COVID-19 to attack reusable bags

Executive Summary

The plastics industry has been waging a PR war in an attempt to interfere with legislation
banning or regulating the use of single-use plastic, notably around plastic bags. Through front
groups, corporate-funded research, and misrepresentation of scientific studies, the plastics
industry has exploited the COVID-19 emergency to create fear about reusable bags and assert
that single-use plastic is necessary to keep people safe.

Two recent studies have concluded that plastics are among the surfaces that human
coronaviruses may survive on for the longest, of several surfaces. After these studies were
publicized in media outlets, several media outlets began portraying researcher “warnings” about
the potential for reusable grocery bags to transmit the new coronavirus, despite the fact that
reusable grocery bags were not among the surfaces examined. Several articles reference older
studies that demonstrated the transmission of certain bacteria via reusable bags, without
mentioning that those studies were funded by the plastics industry, nor the finding that bags
could be disinfected with washing.

These narratives falsely conflate those older studies on bacteria on reusable bags with new
studies about coronaviruses to “prove” that single-use plastic bags are the safest way to prevent
transmission of coronavirus. This is a deflection from the recent studies demonstrating that the
virus will persist on plastic longer than almost any material examined, which could call into
question the safety of the majority of plastic-packaged items in supermarkets.

The professors, spokespeople, and front groups promoting this bait-and-switch misinformation
have numerous financial ties to plastic manufacturers and petrochemical refinery companies.
Many are affiliated with or have been known to work with conservative free-market think tanks
funded by Charles Koch Foundation and fossil fuel-funded clients. These conflicts of interest are
not mentioned in the recent flurry of news reports on these studies. Some states or
municipalities with legislation banning plastic bags or instituting bag fees are now pausing or
delaying legislation or enforcement, citing concerns about COVID-19 specifically linked to this
misinformation. The echo chamber falsely linking coronavirus to reusable grocery bags is a

profit-driven distraction to vital safety information that consumers need in order to navigate the
COVID-19 crisis.

Section 1: Exploiting a Crisis

As COVID-19 spreads, and the public struggles to keep up with evolving understanding of its
transmission, we have seen corporate front groups like Competitive Enterprise Institute,
Manhattan Institute, and American Energy Alliance circulating a string of similar stories and
op-eds which explicitly warn anxious consumers that reusable grocery bags could be spreading
coronavirus, and urge municipalities to repeal bag bans and/or fees. These groups have a
documented history of fossil fuel industry funding (detailed
grocery bags potentially spreading the coronavirus have been picked up and reprinted in an
increasing number of news outlets. This well-established public relations strategy, designed to
create a crisis-driven media ecosystem “echo chamber,” has already helped influence a few
states and municipal governments to delay or pause bans on disposable plastic bags, citing
concerns of COVID-19.

). These stories about reusable

below

It appears that a media campaign was designed to establish and spread the narrative that
“reusable grocery totes could be spreading COVID-19,” and “bag bans should be
suspended due to COVID-19 concern.” The irony is that the campaign relied heavily upon
studies that found that the virus persisted longer on plastic surfaces than other
materials.
and front group-linked “research,” recycling past PR efforts to try to
longevity of COVID-19 on plastic.

 Whoever initiated this narrative was clearly able to draw on previous industry-funded
deflect attention from the

 A chronological analysis of news reports and established industry connections to front groups
and public relations firms reveals some key corporate participants in this carefully orchestrated
misinformation echo chamber;

these efforts are further described below.

● Novolex, one of the country’s largest manufacturers of plastic film and packaging, uses
Edelman as its PR firm. Edelman has a long history of representing fossil fuel industry
clients (who often launder information through these same corporate front groups).
Novolex has been involved in legislative efforts to prevent communities or states from
restricting the use of single-use plastic bags, often through the American Recyclable
Plastic Bag Alliance. Novolex (then Hilex Poly) had underwritten a study by Robert
Kimmel, who appears to be one of the first public voices linking reusable bags to the
spread of COVID-19.

● The American Chemistry Council (ACC) has underwritten at least one of the studies
referenced, specifically a study authored by Charles Gerba and Ryan Sinclair at
University of Arizona and Loma Linda University School of Public Health in 2011. The
ACC has been documented to be interfering in legislative efforts relating to plastic.

● Many of these think tanks that circulated the story early on have a long, documented
history of deploying similar PR tactics for fossil fuel industry clients, such as the
Manhattan Institute, a front group which has been involved in efforts to dismiss climate
science and battle against environmental policies for decades. It is one of the few
remaining anti-climate organizations recently funded by ExxonMobil, which has been

many states and municipalities

In response to consumer concern over plastic pollution, particularly single-use disposable
plastic bags,
 have recently enacted legislation regulating,
outlawing, or disincentivizing the sale or distribution of plastic bags. The location of op-eds or
articles published in recent weeks linking reusable bags to COVID-19 suggest a PR campaign
aimed at states where the laws are recent or about to be enacted in 2020; these include:
Maryland (February/March legislation; House voted March 12), Maine (set to be enforced April
22), New Hampshire (house voted January 2020), New York (set to be enacted March 1, now
delayed until April), Washington State (approved in January 2020). Municipalities that have
taken action include Denver (bag fee, as the state has passed pre-emption laws banning local
bag bans) and Albuquerque (approved January 1).

The plastic bag industry is experienced at spreading a variety of arguments – sometimes
backed up by reports or studies they themselves fund – to blunt or deflect legislative efforts to
eliminate their products. Novolex, headquartered in South Carolina, is one of the largest
manufacturers of plastic bags and film, and manufactures low- and medium-density
polyethylene grocery carrier bags for retailers and convenience stores including Albertsons,
Safeway, Vons (banners of Albertsons Companies), Ralphs (banner of The Kroger Co.),
Walmart, WinCo Foods, Walgreens, and Circle K.  Novolex has a history of using PR and/or
lobbying campaigns to defeat legislation aimed at regulating the use of plastic.  For example,
Novolex funded the Laredo Texas Merchant’s Association to hire an attorney with consulting
firm Thompson Knight to fight a bag ban, a tactic repeated in other legislatures, including
California, Ohio, and New York.      In South Carolina, home of Clemson University, Novolex
and Sonoco, a packaging manufacturer, have both donated to South Carolina candidates and
political committees,and a Novolex-affiliated trade association spent about $88,000 on lobbying
between 2017 and 2019 ; Novolex also appears to have created a front group for the express

 All studies on bags referenced - both industry-funded and not -

Based on an examination of the timeline of stories, the first mention of reusable grocery bags
relating to COVID-19 appeared in the Staten Island Advance, three days after the LiveScience
article was posted. That first article only mentioned supply chain disruptions; a subsequent
article in the Staten Island Advance mentioned prior studies on transmission of bacterial disease
on reusable grocery bags, but did not disclose that one study was underwritten by the ACC. A
few days later, the Staten Island Advocate reported that Professor Robert Kimmel at Clemson
University had emailed the New York State legislature, referencing his own prior research on
reusable grocery bags as “proof” of disease transmission. This article also does not mention
that his 2014 research “A Life Cycle Assessment of Grocery Bags,” was underwritten by plastic

linked the transmission of norovirus aerosols (fomites) from an ill soccer player to
packaged food stored inside a woven polypropylene grocery bag inside the bathroom;
the fomites settled onto the packaged food, plastic bag, or both and sickened the other
players when they passed the bag and food around. The study notes that this case,
“illustrates one of the less obvious hazards of reusable grocery bags” but concludes that
touching the bag could not be analyzed separately from touching or consuming the
packaged food inside the bag. The conclusion indicated the need for disinfecting
potentially contaminated surfaces - inclusive of the bag, bathroom surfaces and
packaged goods within the bathroom.

Lastly, Tierney also references Brooklyn “activist” Allen Moses’ warning, without
referencing Moses’ apparent relationship to Clemson professor Robert Kimmel’s industry
funded packaging research center.

Section 3: Who are these Think Tanks and Who Funds Them

?

These think tanks have many years of experience orchestrating the precise kind of
momentum-gathering narratives that spread throughout the media ecosystem, like wildfire. The
ongoing and evolving spread of the plastic industry's self-serving fallacious narrative, picked up
by outlet after outlet (often in the same states and municipalities where there are active or
pending bans on plastic bags), and echoed across social media platforms, has made use of the
same multi-dimensional conservative infrastructure that climate deniers and other conservative
and corporate interests have used. These include state think tanks (members of the State Policy
Network), libertarian front groups and industry-funded academic "experts" -- many of whom are
academic "double-dippers" who consult for the industry.

Many of these op-eds were published by think tanks who are funded by the fossil fuel industry
and other industries that often mount counter-attacks and PR campaigns when feeling
threatened by new regulations or stiff restrictions on their business. Below we detail some of the
funders  of several of these think tanks, based on analysis of IRS disclosures (990 forms). This
data does not indicate what funding may have been used for. But these groups house some of
the best crisis communications artists out there. They do not necessarily have to be told when to
seize any opportunity to advance their funders’ (or potential funders) interest.

life cycle, from fracking and refining to ingestion of microplastics, ultimately ending as waste
headed to landfills or incineration. What’s worse, they are trying to capitalize on the COVID-19
crisis by playing on people’s fears around sanitation and hygiene. Through front groups and
corporate funded research, the plastic industry is misrepresenting scientific findings to scare
people away from reusable bags even as recent studies reveal the virus lasts longer on plastic
than other materials.

Plastic waste is now found everywhere we look, from the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the
deepest part of the Pacific to the Rocky Mountains and the Pyrenees. We have put so much
plastic into the environment that it is in the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we
breathe. Plastic pollution is putting numerous species at risk, and impacting entire ecosystems.
At a time when it is clear we must phase out our reliance on single-use plastic as quickly as
possible, the plastic industry is fighting a dirty war that threatens to endanger our health and
corrupt public policy.

We will not allow them to succeed.
