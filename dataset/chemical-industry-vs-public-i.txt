Chemical Industry vs. Public Interest:
2Even before the events of September 11, 2001, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wasconcerned that short of a comprehensive site security
plan, chemical facilities handling hazardous substancesthreatened the public ’s safety in case of an accident and/or
intentional criminal mischief such as an act of terrorism.  
As outlined in the February 2000 Chemical Security
Alert, a major component of the EPA ’s proposal to
reduce such threats involved deploying safer designand replacing the hazardous substances used and/orstored at such facilities with safer substances.
1
Later in September 2000, a U.S. EPA assessmentshowed that of the 15,000 facilities reviewed, 123could threaten over a million people living near thefacility should an accident or criminal act jeopardizethe safety of the plant. According to the report, theremaining facilities could put anywhere from a fewindividuals up to hundreds of thousands at risk ofimmediate death or injury.
2
The EPA had good reasons to be concerned about theoperations of such facilities.  
In 1984 a methyl isocyanate leak from the Union
Carbide pesticide manufacturing plant in Bhopal,India claimed more than 8,000 lives in the immediateaftermath and at least 12,000 more since.  Many morewere injured.  T wenty years later, thousands of sur-vivors are suffering from respiratory ailments, cancers,and other health problems while their children areborn with serious birth defects.  
In the U.S., on April 23, 2004 a vinyl chloride leak in
Formosa ’s Plastics ’ Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) facility in
Illiopolis, Illinois killed five workers (four died imme-diately and one died later of injuries sustained duringthe incident), injured three others, and caused theevacuation of a large number of residents.  The inci-dent caused a fire that burned for days, leading toconcerns that “long-term contamination problems
may be fairly monumental. ”
3
These two disasters demonstrate that terrorist attacks
shouldn ’t be the only source of concern when it comes
to overseeing chemical plants.  In fact, often theplants ’ operations and the substances used are the
source of terror.   
Following September 11th, concerned that the pres-
ence of highly hazardous substances at chemical plantscould provide targets for terrorists, the EPA steppedup its investigations into the operations of chemical facili-
ties.  In an internal document dated June 11, 2002, then-EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman and theWhite House Director of the Office of Homeland SecurityTom Ridge, laid out a “Rollout Strategy for Chemical
Facility Site Security ” for the “week of June 10-14 or week INTRODUCTION

Redefining the Public Debate on Chemical Security
3of June 17-21, 2002 ” including a media event in “The
White House Press Room. ”4
Also spurred into action was Senator Jon Corzine (D-NJ)
who on October 31, 2001 introduced the “Chemical
Security Act of 2001 ” (S. 1602), requiring chemical facili-
ties to use safer available technologies to prevent cata-strophic attacks.
But the EPA never had a chance to implement its plans
and Senator Corzine ’s legislation never passed the U.S.
Congress.
Once alerted of plans that could alter their operations, the
U.S. chemical and petroleum industries began cashing inon favors to the Bush campaign.  Since Mr. Bush tookoffice, legislative and regulatory efforts that would makechemical facilities ’ operations inherently safer have been
killed or gutted.  Based on reports submitted by ACC, andon file with the Senate Office of Public Records, during2002 and 2003 the ACC spent $4.3 million on in-houselobbyists, advocating against any mandatory standards forchemical plant security.  
This report examines the actions of the chemical and
petroleum industry between 2001 and the time of thiswriting.  Hiding behind the Bush Administration ’s “War
On Terror, ” the chemical industry —led by the American
Chemistry Council (ACC), and other industry groups suchas the American Petroleum Institute (API) —have lobbied
the Administration to restrict discussions on plant safety tothe adoption of voluntary, industry developed plans. Theseplans are narrowly focused on installing tougher locks onthe gates and hiring more security guards to keep outintruders, and do nothing to address the inherent hazardsassociated with the use of hazardous process and largequantities of hazardous chemicals stored on-site.
Although the industry continued to promote their volun-
tary programs at the June 27-29, 2004 “Second Annual
Chemical Security Summit ” in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
the No More Bhopals Alliance believes the industry ’s con-
flict of interest prevents it from changing its operations toadequately protect the public.
To truly ensure public safety and prevent possible terror
attacks at chemical facilities, the No More Bhopals Allianceoffers the following recommendations:• Mandate adoption of “inherently safe ” materials
and processes, that would require the use of safer,less hazardous substances starting with instanceswhere such alternatives are readily available;
• Promulgate federal regulations mandating
increased vulnerability assessments, site securityand inherent safety changes for hazardous facili-ties, starting with the facilities that threaten themost people;
• Re-route shipments of hazardous substances (eg.,
chlorine, ammonia, hydrogen fluoride, etc.) thatcan be turned into weapons of mass destruction(WMD).
• Mandate the public disclosure of “technology and
materials options analyses ” requiring companies to
report the rationale behind choosing a particularprocess or material over others;
• Strengthen Occupational, Safety, and Health
Administration (OSHA) laws covering chemicallyreactive substances and reactive hazards as request-ed by labor organizations;
• Strengthen and expand the public ’s right-to-know
(eg. Toxic Release Inventory/TRI) by mandatingthe preparation and disclosure of toxics use reduc-tion plans;
• Increase the number of chemicals and industries
covered under TRI reporting;
•Strengthen the liability regime against polluters
and facilities that fail to take adequate steps toprotect workers, communities and the environ-ment.
• Conduct and publish body burden and epidemio-
logical studies on the general population with par-ticular emphasis on vulnerable communities,including pollution-impacted communities,minorities, children, elderly, women and workers;and, 
•Operationalize the Precautionary Principle in fed-
eral and state laws.

Chemical Industry vs. Public Interest:
4Follow The Money
Since September 11th, the Bush Administration has
advised the public to be on the look out for strangefaces and behaviors in public places while it looks for
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) in Iraq.  
All the while, unaided by terrorists and going about busi-
ness as usual, chemical companies have injected terroragents into the general U.S. population in the form of ahost of synthetic chemicals.  Many, known to be highlytoxic, are at levels above permitted thresholds establishedby federal health and environment agencies.
As early as September 2000 report, the EPA identified a
number of chemical facilities using hazardous substancesthat could be used as WMDs to intentionally threaten upto millions of people.
6[See Table 1]However, legislative and regulatory efforts to ensure inher-
ent safety at chemical facilities have expectantly met withresistance from the industry aided by its allies in the BushAdministration.  In fact, it ’s clear that the industry knew it
had an ally in the Bush Administration even before the restof the world saw the events unfold on September 11th andbeyond.
Since before the 2000 presidential elections, an elite group
of donors to the Bush 2000 campaign known as the BushPioneers and Rangers have positioned themselves for favorsfrom Mr. Bush.   Pioneers and Rangers are contributorswho agree to raise $100,000 or more for the BushCampaign.
7
Chemical industry officials are prominent amongst BushPioneers and Rangers —at least seven are among this list of
special donors.
8One Pioneer,
Fredrick Webber, was the chairof ACC from 1992 to 2002,when he retired.  Following the2000 elections, Bush appointedMr. Webber to the LaborDepartment T ransition Team.
Mr. Webber, along with two
other Bush Pioneers,Department of Commerce(DOC) Secretary Don Evansand U.S. Ambassador to theEuropean Union (EU) RockwellSchnabel, played a key role inundermining legislative effortsin Europe requiring mandatorytesting of chemicals for healthand environmental risks beforethey can be used in the region.A 2002 internal DOC commu-niqué urged the U.S. chemical
industry to “develop an official
position and strategy as soon aspossible to assist in influencingthe EU ’s draft. ” 
9HIDING BEHIND THE BUSH
“We’re looking all over Iraq for biological and chemical weapons. We don’t have to look for ‘em very hard, they’re
right here, right here in our backyards.” —Senator Jon Corzine D-NJ 5

Redefining the Public Debate on Chemical Security
5With Aid From Bush, Industry Thwarts
Chemical Security Legislation 
The chemical industry ’s war against chemical security
began in full earnest after the introduction of the“Chemical Security Act of 2001 ” (S. 1602) by Senator Jon
Corzine on October 31, 2001.  The Corzine bill called forlegislation requiring hazardous chemical-using companiesto assess and improve their security, even while deployingsafer alternatives to risky processes and the storage, use andmanufacture of hazardous chemicals. 
After being unanimously adopted by the 20-member Senate
Environment Committee on July 25, 2002, Corzine ’s origi-
nal bill, S. 1602, was subsequently challenged by sevenmembers of the committee. In a letterdated September 10, 2002, the dissentingsenators stated they may have to offeradditional amendments to the HomelandSecurity Act of 2002 to “…address con-
cerns … that have arisen from scores of
stakeholders upon thoughtful considera-tion of this legislation. ”
10
According to information gathered by
Greenpeace from the Center forResponsive Politics, political action com-mittee contributions from the chemicalindustry to the seven dissenters totaled$992,346. In comparison, the remaining thirteen senatorson the committee received a total of only $756,221.
11
Despite unanimous approval in the Senate EnvironmentCommittee, the U.S. Senate passed the Homeland SecurityDepartment Act on November 19, 2002, but failed toinclude S. 1602 or any other chemical security provisionwhile adding new loopholes for polluters that would allowthem to evade enforcement and protect them from publicdisclosure of violations.  
Even though they shunned the Corzine led initiatives, fol-
lowing the 2002 elections with a newly elected Republicancontrolled Congress, the industry and the White Housesuddenly warmed up to legislation.  But none of the meas-ures proposed by the Democrats seemed to fit the bill.
On January 7, 2003 Senator Daschle (D-SD) and 15 other
senators introduced S. 6, a broad homeland security bill,including the July 25, 2002 S enate Environment
Committee compromise bill on chemical security.  Despite
another attempt by Senator Corzine to introduce a chemicalsecurity bill (S. 157) on January 14, 2003 identical to theprevious one as well as a companion bill in the U.S. House ofRepresentatives filed on April 23, 2003 by RepresentativeFrank Pallone (D-NJ), the bills were not included in the finalversions of the Homeland Security Bill.On May 5, 2003 Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), one of the
seven republicans who suddenly backed out of supportingthe Corzine Bill, introduced the Chemical FacilitiesSecurity Act of 2003 (S. 994) which excluded any roles forthe EPA and endorsed voluntary industry programs.
Finally, on October 23, 2003 the Senate Environment
Committee passed the flawed Inhofe bill (S. 994).  The billhas no enforceable provision to prevent catastrophic attacksand merely rubber stamps voluntary industry programs.
Beating EPA ’s Plans To Implement Chemical
Security
An internal EPA document dated June 11,
2002 showed that concurrent to the legisla-tive efforts ongoing at the time, the EPAand the White House Office of HomelandSecurity were collaborating on chemicalsecurity issues. This attempt by the EPA totake control of chemical security in thepost-September 11th climate threatened theindustry ’s current operations.  As stated ear-
lier in this report, the strategy outlined inthe June 11, 2002 EPA document includesdesign changes that would require usingsafer chemicals when available.
12
Although the EPA had indicated it might
seek legislation to enforce its chemical security mandates,in the accompanying “Questions and Answers ” sheet to the
June 11 document, then-EPA Administrator ChristineTodd Whitman states the “EPA is not seeking legislation
on chemical security at this time. ”  Instead, the EPA was
going to use “…existing authority under the Clean Air
Act, we believe that the guidance and regulation I haveannounced today are the quickest paths to improvingchemical facility security...  If we later find that there arelegislative gaps, then we will consider seeking legislation. ”
EPA’s attempts to introduce legislation expanding its
authority under the Clean Air Act ’s Section 112 (r)
13to
include chemical security against criminal attacks were alsokilled by industry lobby groups. 
In addition, instead of adopting its original strategy, the
EPA released yet another “Strategic Plan for Homeland
Security ” in October 2002.  The new strategy contains no
proposal for making the plants inherently safer.
White House To The Rescue
A paper trail discovered by Greenpeace, reveals the WhiteHouse had a lot to do with the defeat of the Corzine leg-islative attempts as well as the EPA ’s efforts to institute
chemical security measures....the White House had
more to do with thedefeat of the Corzinelegislative attempts aswell as the EPA’s effortsto institute chemicalsecurity measures.

Chemical Industry vs. Public Interest:
6In a letter written to James Connaughton, head of White
House Council on Environmental Quality and former lob-byist for the power companies, American PetroleumInstitute ’s (API) Red Cavaney suggests the EPA “has nei-
ther experience nor resources and questionable legalauthority to address security. ”  Instead, Cavaney proposed
that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) bevested with this responsibility.
14DHS has no history, expe-
rience or knowledge of managing chemical facilities nordoes it seem to harbor any inclinations to regulate them.
Cavaney ’s language mirrors the line taken by the chemical
industry. In September 2002, Michael Graff, president ofPolymers Americas (a division of ACC member BPAmoco), wrote to the President Bush ’s Senior Advisor Karl
Rove thanking him for “. . .meeting with my American
Chemistry Council colleagues and I (sic). . .to share ourconcerns regarding S. 1602, the Corzine-Jeffords Bill. ”
15
Graff, too, recommended that DHS be appointed to
address chemical security issues by allowing ACC to pro-vide the framework for implementation of the depart-ment ’s directives.
In response, Mr. Rove wrote to Mr. Graff acknowledging
his letter and stating  “We [at the White House] have a
similar set of concerns about its [Corzine-Jeffords Bill]positions. ”
16
In his December 2003 Directive on Homeland Security,
President Bush limited the EPA ’s chemical security role to
“drinking water and water treatment systems. ”17In a legallyquestionable move, this shifted all responsibility for the
nearly 15,000 chemical plants from the EPA to the DHS.
Workers Be Damned
The Bush and ACC team didn ’t stop at the EPA or the
U.S. Congress.
After he took office, Mr. Bush resolved a long-standing
issue for the ACC. In an October 1997 presentation toOSHA, four industry trade organizations, including theChemical Manufacturers Association (CMA now renamedACC) and the Synthetic Organic Chemical ManufacturersAssociation (SOCMA) jointly urged OSHA “not to expand
the Process Safety Management (PSM) rule in an attemptto address the very difficult issue of reactive hazards. ”
18The
PSM rule was aimed at enhancing occupational safety.
Finally, in 2002 with help from the White House, the
industry got its wish. Ironically, on December 3, 2002 —
the 18th anniversary of the Union Carbide disaster inBhopal —a note in the Federal Register revealed the chemi-
cals initiative was being dropped because of “resource con-
straints and other problems. ” By February 2003, OSHA ’s
budget was slashed by $7.9 million and its workforcereduced by 83 jobs, according to the Center for PublicIntegrity ’s report.
Later, the public interest group OMB Watch, found that
the chemicals initiative was part of a non-public industry“hit list ” of 57 regulations comprising items that the indus-
try considered too burdensome.

Redefining the Public Debate on Chemical Security
7Twenty years after a runaway reaction in Union
Carbide ’s pesticide factory in Bhopal, India, killed
more than 8,000 people in the immediate after-
math, chemical accidents in U.S. industries continue tooccur with frightening regularity.
Between January 2003 and April 2004, at least 10 inci-
dents serious enough to trigger root cause investigations bythe U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) have been reported.These industrial accidents, including one at ACC membercompany Honeywell, have claimed the lives of 20 workers,injured more than 230, and caused the evacuation of atleast 2,000 people.
19
Accidents at ACC member facilities runcounter to ACC ’s claims that its
Responsible Care program actively assessesand minimizes hazards.
CSB investigation of an accident on
March 13, 2001 at ACC member BPAmoco Polymers plant in Augusta,Georgia implicates the company as havingbeen negligent. The accident killed threeworkers. The CSB ’s notes on the con-
tributing and root causes of the disasterare revealing. Most notably, the boardobserves that:
• Incidents and near misses tended to be treated as isolat-
ed events. Management did not have a review system todetect trends and patterns among incidents.
• Neither Amoco ’s R&D department nor the process
design department had a systematic procedure specifi-cally for identifying and controlling hazards from unin-tended or uncontrolled chemical reactions.
20
Working with a compilation of chemical accidents report-ed to the National Response Center, U.S. PIRG pegged thetotal number of accidents at facilities owned by ACCmember companies at 25,188 between 1990 and 2003.Nearly 33 percent of all accidents at ACC facilitiesoccurred in factories owned by industry leaders BP , Dowand DuPont.
21
Following another CSB investigation into an October2002 explosion at First Chemical Corp in Pascagoula,Mississippi, a CSB member said: “We are very fortunate
that shrapnel from the tower did not cause a greater chem-ical release or a more damaging fire. This accident under-scores once again the vital importance of properly manag-ing dangerous reactive chemicals and the processes that usethem. ”
22Shrapnel from First Chemical ’s explosion narrowly
missed chemical storage tanks at a neighboring Chevronrefinery. The CSB investigation found the company hadnot properly evaluated hazards, although the companyclaimed to have been following SOCMA ’s voluntary safety
policies.
Job Security = Chemical Security
Responding to a 1994 survey, the Industrial Safety and
Hygiene News magazine found three-quarters of the respon-
dents —mostly industry personnel —said business competi-
tion and downsizing is forcing them to cutsafety spending.  Nearly 80 percentbelieved accidents are more likely asemployees work longer hours, handle newassignments and fear for their jobs.
27
A March 2003 GAO report “Voluntary
Initiatives are Under Way at ChemicalFacilities but the Extent of SecurityPreparedness is Unknown ” cites industry
officials to conclude that “...chemical com-
panies must weigh the cost of implement-ing countermeasures against the perceivedreduction in risk. ”
The Conference Board reports “The per-
ceived need to upgrade corporate security has clashed withthe perceived need to control expenses until the economyrecovers. ”
28
Workers are often the first victims when safety is compro-
mised to cut costs.  
The most significant among the unlearned lessons from
the Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal is the important roleof workers. It is undisputed that Union Carbide systemati-cally ignored workers ’ warnings about plant safety and even
fired workers that raised such issues. During the cost-cut-ting drive that pre-ceded the disaster, Union Carbide laidoff safety personnel and other workers, reduced safetytraining and cut back expenditure on safety systems.“Maintenance personnel [at the fateful Methyl Isocyanate
unit] were cut from six to two. In 1983, the fire and rescuesquad was filled with unqualified persons and laterchanged to an emergency squad. One month prior to thedisaster, the vital post of maintenance supervisor was elimi-nated from the night shift. ”
29The rest of what happened at
midnight on December 2-3, 1984, is history.
As the CSB ’s Poje observes, “The analogy of Bhopal stillDRIVING DANGEROUSLY
Accidents at ACC mem-
ber facilities run counterto ACC ’s claims that its
Responsible Care pro-gram actively assessesand minimizes hazards.

Chemical Industry vs. Public Interest:
8resonates here because of the endangerment
due to downsizing. ”30
Drawing upon limited data relating to the peri-
od 1992-2001, when 91 deaths of contractemployees were known to have resulted fromexplosions or asphyxiation in industrial plants,the Center to Protect Workers ’ Rights found
many instances of injury/death were caused bythe lack of workers ’ knowledge of the presence
of explosive material, or the lack of adequateprecaution.
31The report recommends “the use
of outside contractors working in industrialplants should be reviewed to determine uniquesafety risks and needs for this group. ”
Lacking Hazard Prevention
The CSB ’s second observation on reactive haz-
ards and unintended or uncontrolled chemicalreactions raises the far more sinister specter of aBhopal-like disaster recurring. Limited dataanalyzed by the board “include 167 serious inci-
dents in the United States involving uncon-trolled chemical reactivity from January 1980 toJune 2001. Forty of these incidents resulted in atotal 108 fatalities. ”
32Seventy percent of the
incidents investigated involved the chemicalmanufacturing industry.
Reactive chemicals can become dangerously
unstable when they inadvertently or improperlycome in contact with other chemicals, water orair, or when they ’re subjected to heat or pres-
sure. The resulting instability can cause fairlyrapid and large runaway reactions that couldbreach containment measures, as happened inBhopal or more recently and less catastrophical-ly in BP Amoco ’s Georgia plant.
According to the EPA, in the early to mid-1980s
at least 17 accidents in the U.S. had potentialconsequences that could have been more severethan Bhopal, given the toxicity and volume ofrelease. Mass fatalities were averted only due tocircumstances like wind conditions and plantlocation.
33
“The current regulatory regime to deal with
reactive hazards and incidents is not adequate, ”
says CSB ’s Gerald Poje. In October 2002, the
CSB submitted its recommendations to the gov-ernment, industry and labor unions on address-ing vulnerabilities in sectors using or storingreactive chemicals. As is the case with mostchemical facility hazards, reactive hazards placeworkers in the first line of fire. Rolling Back Controls
The ACC —previously called the Chemical Manufacturers ’
Association (CMA) —and their membership have been influ-
encing policy and working to undermine environmentallaws and regulations for years. Here are some examples:
GThe public interest group Earthjustice warned that “An
illegal chemical industry advisory committee is playingan inside role in weakening endangered species protec-tions from harmful pesticides. ”
23The FIFRA endangered
species task force of the EPA —comprising 14 agrochem-
ical companies —set up in 2000 to develop data dis-
closing the locations of endangered species, “has shifted
its efforts away from generating data to advocating thatEPA circumvent the Endangered Species Act for pesticideuses that harm federally protected species. ” Six out of
14 industry members of the taskforce are ACC compa-nies or their subsidiaries.
24
GIn a 1999 report,25U.S. PIRG and others outlined the
role of the CMA in lobbying Congress —with occasional
success —to:  
• Remove 90 percent of TRI chemicals;
• Cut EPA ’s 1996 and 1997 budget, including a
proposal to cut $1.5 million from funds designatedto expand the TRI;
• Block EPA ’s authority to collect improved data under
TRI; and,
• Prevent EPA from prosecuting polluters who have
hidden environmental violations in secret self-auditsauthorized by state law.
GThe same U.S. PIRG report documents a paper trail
showing how the CMA tried to directly block EPA effortsto improve Right-to-Know.
GIn 1999, giving in to pressure from ACC and the
American Petroleum Institute, Congress limited publicaccess to Risk Management Plans (RMP) that companiesare required to file as a measure leading to accidentprevention under EPA ’s Clean Air Act. After September
11th, information was further restricted purportedly toprevent access to sensitive data by terrorists and othercriminal agents even though RMPs contain “no data on
tank or process location, site security or other similarinformation. ”
26

Redefining the Public Debate on Chemical Security
9In April 2002, the Center for Public Integrity released a
report of its investigations that found the BushAdministration had quietly shelved an OSHA proposal toimprove workplace and chemical safety. The proposal wasprompted by a petition by several industrial and firefighters ’
unions. The Clinton-era proposal, which aimed to expandthe Process Safety Management (PSM) standard that formsthe core of OSHA ’s accident-prevention regulations, was
opposed by Bush campaign donors.
Poisoning the Vulnerable
In the year 2000, facilities required to report emissions oftoxic pollutants under the Toxics Release Inventory regula-tion released more than:
• 100 million pounds of carcinogens
• 138 million pounds of chemicals that could cause devel-
opmental problems
• 50 million pounds of chemicals that could cause repro-
ductive disorders
• 1 billion pounds of known/suspected neurotoxicants
• 1.7 billion pounds of respiratory toxicants
• 7000 grams of dioxins
According to the 2000 TRI, of the 7 kilograms of dioxins
—the most dangerous chemical known to science —report-
ed by all industries more than 2 kilograms were released byACC members Dow Chemical and Solutia Inc., with Dowemitting about 1.4 kilograms.
People living near or working at incinerators, Superfund
sites, and chemical and other industrial facilities and eventhe general population are forced to pay forindustrial pollution by absorbing associatedhealth care costs and wages lost due to ill-health.
A study by Dr. Philip Landrigan of Mt. Sinai
Medical Center et al estimates the total annualcosts of environmental pollutants and diseasein American children at $54.9 billion, or 2.8percent of total US health care costs.
34The
authors report that, “This estimate is likely low
because it considers only four categories of ill-ness, incorporates conservative assumptions,ignores costs of pain and suffering... ” 
35
Between three and four million children and
adolescents in the United States live withina mile of a federally designated Superfundhazardous waste disposal site and are at riskof exposure to chemical toxicants releasedfrom these sites.
36
The January 2003 study by Center forDisease Control37analyzed a nationally representative
group of 2,500 people for 116 synthetic toxicants. Thestudy found adolescents and adult women were most dis-proportionately exposed to phthalates, a chemical used incosmetics, children ’s toys and soft PVC items like shower
curtains. Mexican Americans in the sample had higher lev-els than others of DDE, a breakdown product of DDT;African American women of child-bearing age carried thehighest levels of the neurotoxin mercury in their bodies.Most worryingly, children had higher body burdens thanadults for some of the most toxic chemicals includingorganophosphate pesticides such as chlorpyriphos, leadand tobacco smoke.
An authoritative 1997 study found that African American,
and Hispanic residential areas are more likely to beexposed to higher levels of environmental risk associatedwith TRI facilities and TRI pollutant loads.
38Often these
communities are already overburdened, poor, and political-ly under-represented.
Chlorpyriphos, marketed under the Dow Chemical brand-
name, Dursban, is dangerous, particularly to children.Using a Pesticide T respass Index to estimate the extent towhich individual manufacturers of pesticides are responsi-ble for the body burdens, Pesticide Action Network NorthAmerica analyzed the CDC data to find that 80 percent ofthe US population ’s chlorpyriphos body burden is the
responsibility of the Dow Chemical Corporation.
39
The ACC ’s response to the CDC study twists the con-
demning data into a tribute to the chemical industry. “It is
remarkable that modern chemistry allows CDC scientiststo measure incredibly small amounts of certain nutrients,natural food chemicals and modern chemicals in our bod-ies,” says the ACC.

Chemical Industry vs. Public Interest:
10DO YOU LIVE IN BHOPAL?
A CHECKLIST FOR COMMUNITIES AND WORKERS
The December 1984 Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, India, is alluded to, even by industry offi-
cials. The facts of the disaster are sobering. Here ’s a checklist of why things went so horribly wrong
in Bhopal before, during and after the disaster. To get an idea of your vulnerability, go down thechecklist to see how many of the items resonate with the context of your neighborhood facility or thefactory you work in.
❏Does the plant use inherently unsafe technology?
❏Are large quantities of extremely hazardous substances used
or stored onsite?
❏Is the facility located in a densely populated community?
❏Are community members predominantly low-income and
disadvantaged? 
❏Is the factory run by a powerful corporation with the lobby muscle of the industry behind it?
❏Does the company practice a management pattern that ignores worker and community concerns
about frequent incidents and injuries?
❏Is the company actively engaged in downsizing and cost-cutting?
❏Are your local, state and federal Governments beholden to Corporations?
❏Does your legal system have a weak liability regime to hold
offenders accountable?
❏Does your regulatory system lack adequate public disclosure standards for information relat-
ed to chemicals stored, hazards, disaster potential and disaster management?
❏ Can the company refuse to disclose
unpublished chemical-specific information
relating to issues such as toxicity undertrade secret laws?
If your answer is “Yes” to all or
