# Liquefied Natural Gas Exports 101

Discover the environmental risks and climate implications of the United
States’ surging Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) exports, threatening communities
and undermining our climate goals.

In recent years, the United States has become the world’s largest oil and gas
driller, and an increasing amount of fossil gas production is being directly
exported to other countries in the form of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). This
surge of exports threatens the health of U.S. communities and risks putting
our climate goals out of reach. On this page, we collect research and
resources that tell the story of LNG exports – and what we can do to stop
them.
