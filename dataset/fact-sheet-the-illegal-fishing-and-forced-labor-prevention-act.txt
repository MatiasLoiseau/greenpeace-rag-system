THE ILLEGAL FISHING AND
FORCED LABOR PREVENTION ACT:
A BILL TO COMBAT ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED, AND UNREGULATED FISHING
AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AT SEA
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, a top threat to ocean ecosystems and
global food security, is inextricably linked to human rights abuses at sea. Workers on
fishing vessels around the world routinely deal with multiple abuses at sea—withholding of
pay, debt bondage, beatings, excessive working hours, and much more. IUU fishing, human
trafficking, and forced labor in the seafood industry are human rights and environmental
crises that demand swift action.
Fishing operations that engage in human trafficking and
forced labor are often the same ones that ignore fisheries
management regulations and laws. Illegal fishing is not
a small problem. Of the annual global seafood catch, an
estimated one-third—as much as 56 billion pounds—
is illegally fished.1 IUU fishing contributes greatly to
overfishing, which has impacted fisheries around the world.
Depletion of nearshore fisheries resources exacerbates
human rights abuses, forcing vessels to travel farther and
remain out at sea longer, raising costs, and increasing
incentives to engage in illegal labor practices and abuses.

As it becomes harder to find laborers willing to voluntarily
work in these conditions, more operators resort to human
trafficking to assemble crews. Further, demand in the U.S.
and elsewhere for cheap seafood contributes to low prices in
some markets that do not reflect the true cost of production.
The United States imports more seafood than any other
single nation in the world and is thus in a unique position to
deal with these intertwined crises. Lack of action means U.S.
dollars are perpetuating these problems. With its strength of
governance and ample resources, the United States should
be able to reject illegally fished and unethically harvested

seafood from its commerce stream. Yet, according to a recent
report by the U.S. International Trade Commission, the
United States imported an estimated $2.4 billion worth of
seafood derived from IUU fishing in 2019.2
By requiring information about the origins of seafood and its
supply chains, tracking seafood from boat to plate, expanding
transparency, and working with other countries to drive
changes on the water, the United States could lead in the
fight against IUU fishing, forced labor, and other human
rights abuses. Congress and federal agencies have laid the
groundwork with initiatives such as the Seafood Import
Monitoring Program and capacity-building with other nations
