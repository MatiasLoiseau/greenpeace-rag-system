Introduction

Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) has moved
firmly onto the agenda as the parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) approach the climate change
negotiations at the Conference of the Parties (COP) 15 at Copenhagen in
December 2009.  REDD is an option that could rapidly and cost-effectively
reduce GHG emissions and could also protect biodiversity and benefit local and
indigenous peoples. Furthermore, the engagement of the United States and
others has heightened interest in, and debate about, the use of emissions offsets
to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals.

In this paper we investigate the impact of implementing REDD in the context of
a global effort to combat climate change.  Specifically, we explore the effects of
incorporating REDD in international carbon markets.  We expand on previous
modelling efforts by simulating carbon market interactions under expanded
Annex I commitments which are aligned with the goal of avoiding a greater
than 2.0-2.4°C rise in global temperatures.

Both policy makers and the general reader may find the implications for
compliance costs, Annex I abatement and non-REDD offsets of particular
interest.   Section 1 introduces the context of our study.  Section 2 follows with a
description of other relevant modelling efforts and our chosen methodology.
Section 3 presents high-level results while Section 4 opens discussion on some
policy implications of our numerical findings.  Section 5 concludes.  The
appendix contains detailed numerical results.

Context

The human, economic, and environmental costs of even a 2°C rise in mean
global temperatures have been assessed as substantial.  The Stern review
estimates the economic costs of climate change could exceed 20% of Global GDP
(Stern 2006, 2008).

The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other GHGs in the Earth’s
atmosphere serve to regulate the Earth’s energy balance.  Increases in the levels
of CO2 and other GHGs will increase the amount of solar radiation which will
remain trapped in the Earth’s energy system and lead to increased global
temperatures.

1

Human activities are causing the level of GHGs to rise.  Fossil fuel combustion
contributes approximately 28 Gt CO2/yr and land-use change contributes
another 5.5 Gt CO2/yr.  The increased flux of CO2 into the atmosphere is
partially offset by increased absorption of carbon by the oceans (8.1 Gt CO2/yr)
and other ecosystems (10.3 Gt CO2/yr), leaving an annual increase of
approximately 15 Gt CO2/yr (Canadell et al., 2007).

Land-use change, therefore, figures prominently in this equation.  Deforestation
is by far the single largest source of land-use change emissions. Lord Stern
attributed deforestation with emissions in excess of 8 GtCO2/yr in 2000 (Stern
2006).  These emissions are somewhat offset by absorption through revegetation
of cleared lands and reforestation.

Deforestation emissions arise in a number of ways.  The largest source is the
carbon dioxide which enters the atmosphere when the carbon stored in trees
(and other forms of vegetation) is released as a result of burning or as unburned
organic matter decays over time.  Deforestation also disrupts soil, particularly
in peat forests, causing it to release a proportion of its carbon stores into the
atmosphere.

The role of REDD

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in order
to have a medium likelihood of limiting global temperature rise to 2.0-2.4°C,
developed nations will need to reduce their emissions by between 25% and 40%
from their 1990 levels by 2020 and to between 80% and 95% by 2050 (Gupta et
al., 2007). The IPCC also suggests that in addition to developed country cuts,
developing countries will also need to realise significant reductions: a 15%-30%
reduction versus baseline in 2020 (den Elzen and Höehne, 2008).

With deforestation emissions representing up to 20% of anthropogenic
emissions (Schlamadinger et al., 2007), REDD has been heralded as being
instrumental to developing the scale of reductions necessary to limit the
increase in global temperatures to 2°C.  At the same time, proponents note
investments in protecting tropical forests could richly reward biodiversity
protection and improve livelihoods.

What remains clear is that it is critical for the overall effort to mitigate the
harmful effects of climate change that significant reductions in deforestation are

2

required by the year 2020 to provide a reasonable chance of global temperature
remaining below 2°C (Norway, 2008).

REDD design issues

Most REDD proposals identify global funds or emissions trading markets (or
both) as preferred sources of funding.1

Market advocates cite the advantages of economic efficiency and the ability to
mobilise the large amounts of capital. Advocates of funds emphasise the
potential impacts of integration with emissions markets such as volatility, a
reduced carbon price signal, and the substitution of low-quality units for higher
quality ones.

Some proponents propose intermediate options that seek to avoid the problems
of REDD integration with the broader carbon market but that could provide
greater capital mobilisation than through a traditional fund.  For example, the
dual markets approach from the Center for Clean Air Policy attempts to
leverage the power of market driven investment allocation while avoiding
complications of direct integration into global compliance markets (Ogonowski
et. al., 2007).  Similarly, the hybrid Tropical Deforestation Emission Reduction
Mechanism (TDERM) proposal by Greenpeace specifies the creation of a special
unit, the Tropical Deforestation Emission Reduction Unit (TDERU), which
would represent both emissions abatement and other ecosystem services.
Developed nations would take on requirements to purchase TDERUs as part of
their overall emission reduction commitments (Hare and Macey 2007; Thies and
Czebiniak, 2008).

Measurement accuracy, non-permanence issues, and leakage are some of the
numerous complications that must be addressed in designing a REDD
mechanism.  Measurement difficulties include the difficulty of establishing the
precise area and carbon content of forests and accounting for inter-annual
variation of deforestation rates.  As most proposals provide for an incentive
payment for reductions in the rates of deforestation, it is important to be able to
accurately identify what the deforestation rate would have been to avoid the
generation of “hot air” (a situation where compensation will be paid for

Box 1: Notes on the 2˚C target assumption

For the purpose of this report we have focused on emissions reductions consistent with the goal of
maintaining a medium likelihood of keeping the global average temperature rise limited to 2˚C.  How
do we assess what reductions are necessary to meet this goal?  (See Box 2 in the references section for
a selection of relevant sources.)

Hare and Meinshausen (2006) aggregated the results from 11 global climate models and developed a
probabilistic representation (Figure 1) which shows that a 450 ppm CO2-eq stabilisation level is
required for a medium likelihood of reaching the 2˚C goal.

 Probability of reaching a 2° C target by CO2 stabilization level

The IPCC, in Box 13.7 of the IPCC 4th Assessment Working Group III report (Figure 2)(IPCC 2007),
delineated its estimates of what emission reductions would be required to limit the atmospheric
concentration of GHGs to 450 ppm CO2-eq.

Notes:
a The aggregate range is based on multiple approaches to apportion emissions between regions (contraction and convergence,

multistage, Triptych and intensity targets, among others).  Each approach makes different assumptions about the pathway, specific
national efforts and other variables.  Additional extreme cases – in which Annex I undertakes all reductions, or non-Annex I
undertakes all reductions – are not included.  The ranges presented here do not imply political feasibility, nor do the results reflect
cost variances.

b Only the studies aiming at stabilization at 450 ppm CO2-eq assume a (temporary) overshoot of about 50 ppm (See Den Elzen and

Meinshausen, 2006).

reductions that would have occurred anyway).  Leakage would arise if
deforestation is reduced in one country or region, but consequently increases in
another area due to the continued presence of demand for timber or arable land
or a shifting of extractive capital.

If REDD is to be included in an international agreement, it is critical to ensure
the environmental integrity of any REDD activities, while providing incentives
for investment in a viable source of emissions reductions.  Failure to achieve
both of these objectives carries a risk of falling short of our goal of keeping
global temperature rise as low as possible.

Toward some clarity

This study evaluates the wholesale integration of REDD into global carbon
markets.  Partial integration, parallel markets, or dual-market scenarios are not
addressed in this study.

We focus on activity levels inline with the overall goal to keep the global
temperature increase to below 2˚C.  To maintain relevance to this goal, we
simulate a range of emissions reduction commitments consistent with the 2˚C
target. We also analyse commitment levels consistent with recently stated
national emissions reduction targets.

We explore the dynamics of market integration in the year 2020.  The study
provides information on relative investment levels, price impacts, financial
transfers, and net economic benefit for the Annex I region, Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) regions, and REDD regions.  Although serious qualitative
questions have been raised about potential REDD credits, as well as for the
CDM, the quality of all reductions is assumed to be equivalent for the purposes
of simulating market interactions.

2.  Modelling of REDD carbon market interactions

2.1  Previous work

Anger and Sathaye (2008) investigated the detailed implications of integrating
REDD into international carbon markets utilising a multi-region, partial

5

equilibrium model.  They predicted international carbon prices could roughly
halve in 2020 if REDD credits were provided full access to carbon markets.

Anger et al. (2009) expanded on the assumptions of the Anger and Sathaye
work.  Policy scenarios with supply and demand restrictions on REDD credit
trading were added. The impact of increased commitment levels and sensitivity
to REDD credit supply were also explored.  The study found that if there were
no restrictions on access of REDD credits to emissions markets, Annex I
emissions would need to be capped at approximately 23% below 1990 levels
(60% lower than business-as-usual) in order to avoid a reduction in the
international carbon price.

The Eliasch review, released at the end of 2008, also modelled the impacts of
incorporating REDD units in international carbon markets.  The review
integrated updated estimates of deforestation opportunity costs from GCOMAP
(Generalized Comprehensive Mitigation Assessment Process, Sathaye et al.,
2008) into the United Kingdom Office of Climate Change Global Carbon
Finance Model (GLOCAF) model.  The review concluded that, if
supplementarity limits are utilised, introducing REDD has a minimal impact on
the overall price of carbon.  The report concludes that supplementarity
requirements are sufficient to prevent adverse carbon price impacts due to the
existence of a large supply of similar cost mitigation within Annex I economies
(Eliasch, 2008).

The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) utilised a spreadsheet model to
investigate the impact of REDD unit imports on compliance markets in the
European Union and the United States.  Under the EDF’s model, the use of
REDD credits reduces the permit price by approximately 13%, compared with
Anger et al.’s estimate of a 45% decrease in the international permit price.  The
unlimited banking of REDD credits is a key policy assumption of the EDF
model.  Banking is incorporated by equalising the real price of carbon over time
using a 5% discount rate (Cabezas and Keohane, 2008).

Estimates for the quantity of emissions reductions that can be delivered from
REDD vary, as do the estimates of the cost of reductions.  Comparison amongst
the modelling results can be problematic, however, as assumptions are often
inconsistent.  For example,   Sathaye et al. (2008) calculate the total baseline
deforestation for 2020 as 4.5 GtCO2-eq per year.  This figure is somewhat less

6

than the 5.8 Gt CO2-eq emitted from deforestation activities since 1990
according to the IPCC (2007).  The EDF study adopted baseline deforestation
data from the Energy Modeling Forum 21 (2003) which identifies baseline
emissions of between 1.5 and 2.8 Gt CO2-eq due to tropical deforestation in
2020.

2.2  Modelling approach

Following from Anger & Sathaye (2008) and Anger et al. (2009), we utilise a
numerical partial equilibrium model of the global carbon market in the year
2020 to quantify the carbon market impacts of integrating reduced deforestation
credits.  The model enforces a balance between the supply and demand for
emissions reductions in an international, post-2012 compliance market.

The demand for emissions reductions in the model is constant and equivalent to
the net global emissions reduction commitment for the post-2012 period.

The model employs marginal abatement cost functions based on energy-system
data.  Marginal abatement cost functions for REDD are integrated into the
model by treating tropical rainforest areas as explicit model regions. Within this
model framework, developing countries may export emissions reduction credits
from reducing deforestation to Annex I regions via the global carbon market.

In order to maintain consistency with previous work, energy intensive and non-
energy intensive sectors for Annex I and CDM regions are incorporated into the
model independently.

A partial equilibrium model has been selected based on the ability of such
models to represent the specific institutional characteristics of the future carbon
market and explicitly incorporate marginal abatement cost functions.  This
approach facilitates an explicit analysis of carbon price development, regional
emission reductions and carbon credit flows emerging from alternative climate
policy regimes.

The modelling thus represents a transparent approach that allows simulation
results to be easily interpreted by policy makers.  A file containing the model
code which can be used to replicate the results of this paper is available for

Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) format.2

2.3  Scenarios

Commitments

We focus on quantifying REDD’s impact on efforts to limit the increase in
average global temperature to a 2˚C range.  The base case assumes
commitments are equivalent to publicly stated targets as of December 2008.  In
percentage terms, our base case represents a 12.1% global reduction versus
business-as-usual emissions in 2020, but a 34% increase from 1990 levels.

The other commitment levels modelled are within the range of a 25% to 40%
reduction in Annex I emissions (compared to 1990 levels) recommended by the
IPCC as necessary to avoid a greater than 2.0-2.4˚C rise in global temperatures
(see Box 1).  Aggregate Annex I reductions of 25%, 30% and 40% versus 1990
levels are modelled.3

Policy variables

The carbon market is first simulated without REDD credits to establish a
reference case.  Integration of REDD units without restriction is then studied.
Demand restrictions – or supplementarity requirements – are simulated in the
model.  Twenty percent and 50% supplementarity requirements4 were chosen
for analysis.

Our simulation assumes that the CDM will continue, in its current form, into
the post-2012 period.  Furthermore, it is assumed that there are no restrictions
on the integration of CDM units into the global carbon market.

It is also assumed that REDD credits are either directly fungible in the
international compliance market or they are widely integrated into regional

more information on GAMS.

3   For the purposes of this paper, a “25% reduction target” will refer to a 25% reduction in Annex I emissions versus 1990

levels.  The same convention is used for 30% and 40% reduction targets.

4   For the purposes of this study, a 20% supplementarity requirement refers to limiting Annex I import of REDD credits to
20% of Annex I mitigation requirements with respect to the baseline.  By contrast, in the Second Phase of the EU ETS,
imports of Joint Implementation (JI) and CDM credits were limited to 13% of a region/sector’s emissions cap.  For the
Third Phase, a proposal has been made to allow up to 50% of any increases in commitments to be met by JI or CDM
credits. See European Commission (2008).

emissions trading schemes and it is therefore possible to abstract to global
trading.

Sensitivity

The supply and cost of REDD credits can and is highly uncertain.  Natural
effects (such as drought, fire or pests), agricultural prices, and land-use policy
can greatly affect the rate of deforestation and consequently the supply of
REDD credits to the international market.

The design of a REDD mechanism may also influence the supply of REDD
credits to the market.  For example, if a REDD mechanism’s baselines were set
higher than our modelled baseline, the supply of REDD credits would expand.
Conversely, if a REDD mechanism led to discounting of REDD credits, or if it
involved strict quality measures which limited participation, the resulting
REDD supply could be much less than we model.  Due to these factors which
contribute to uncertainty of supply, we tested sensitivity around REDD supply.

A summary of the modelled scenarios is shown in Table 1.

2.4  Key assumptions

The regional grouping applied to the model framework is shown in Table 2.
While the model calculates abatement for each of the regions separately, we
have aggregated the demand for emissions reductions credits from Annex I
countries.  This allows the total Annex I commitment level to be adjusted
without explicitly determining a burden sharing arrangement for each scenario.

Historical carbon emissions and baseline data used in the simulation are shown
in Table 3 in Appendix A. The baseline projects global emissions to increase
52.4% between 1990 and 2020.

The MAC functions employed in the model for the Annex I and CDM regions
are taken directly from Anger et al. (2009).  The functions take the form of third-
degree polynomials based on results from simulations by the energy system
model POLES (Criqui et al, 1999).  POLES explicitly models energy technology
options for emissions abatement in various world regions and sectors. In the
POLES simulations a sequence of carbon taxes was imposed on the respective
regions to identify sectoral emissions abatement.  Following Böhringer et al.
(2005), the coefficients for MAC functions in 2020 are estimated by an ordinary
least squares (OLS) regression of marginal abatement costs and associated
emissions abatement. Table 4 in Appendix A shows the MAC coefficients by
region and sector in 2020.

MAC functions for reducing deforestation are generated by applying a similar
methodology as above to results obtained from the GCOMAP model.  Net
carbon stock changes are established by applying a sequence of carbon prices
(here: 5 to 100 US$ per ton of carbon) to the rainforest regions within the
GCOMAP model.  Table 5 (in Appendix A) illustrates the MAC coefficients for

10

avoided deforestation for the four tropical regions in 2020. Departing from
Anger et al. (2009), we have utilised updated GCOMAP data from Sathaye et al.
(2008) which was incorporated in modelling for the Eliasch review.  As
mentioned above in Section 2.1, Sathaye et al. estimated a baseline emissions
level of 4.5 GtCO2/yr from deforestation in 2020.

3.  Modelling results and assessment

3.1  Results and assessment for current commitments

The carbon market simulation of our base case, which allows the import of
CDM offset credits to meet publicly stated targets, yields a carbon price of 16.0
€/tCO2.5 Introducing REDD credits without restriction reduces the international
price of carbon 61% to 6.2 €/tCO2.  A previous study obtained carbon prices of
15.7 €/tCO2 and 8.6 €/tCO2 respectively for these scenarios (Anger et al. 2008).

Abatement

Figure 3 illustrates the relative scale of share of abatement between Annex I and
offset sources across the scenarios for current commitments. It shows a 57%
reduction in Annex I domestic abatement when REDD is introduced into the
carbon market without restriction under the REDD_CUR scenario.  As the total
emissions reduction is fixed for these scenarios, introduction of REDD imports
displaces domestic Annex I emission reductions and exports from the CDM
regions.  Forty-six percent of the REDD volume substitutes Annex I domestic
abatement and the remaining 54% substitutes CDM credits.

Application of supplementarity restrictions increases domestic abatement by
restricting the import of REDD credits.  Demand is limited, yet each rainforest
region is unrestricted in bringing REDD credits to market.  This leads to a price
separation between the clearing price for REDD credits (2.1 €/tCO2) and the
international carbon price (12.6 €/tCO2) when 20% supplementarity is applied to
REDD trading under current targets.

While the supplementarity approach would increase both the international
carbon price and domestic abatement, a 20% supplementarity limit would result
in 33% of the deforestation reductions achieved under the unrestricted scenario.

5   Carbon prices in this report should be considered representative and useful for comparison between scenarios rather than

as a prediction for the actual price of carbon in the year 2020. Carbon prices are in 2005 euros.

11

Assuming an average biomass value of 250 t-CO2/ha6, this equates to a
difference of 5.5 million hectares of deforestation annually.

Environmental impact

For the purposes of our simulation, we assume that the rules for REDD
mechanisms effectively address environmental integrity issues with REDD
credits.  Provided the emissions reductions associated with a REDD credit are
actually equivalent to those associated with domestic Annex I reductions, the
net flux of CO2 into the atmosphere in 2020 would be equivalent under each
scenario.  If REDD credits were less representative of actual emissions
reductions than comparable Annex I or CDM units, however, then more CO2
would be emitted to the atmosphere under any of the REDD scenarios than in
the case without REDD integration.

Compliance costs and financial transfers

Compliance costs7 generally decrease for Annex I as the price of carbon
decreases.  In the case of full REDD fungibility, Annex I compliance costs
decrease 54% with the introduction of the additional supply of offsets. While

6   This value corresponds to the average biomass value for Africa used in the GCOMAP model (Sathaye et al. 2008).
7   Compliance costs are defined as the cost of domestic abatement plus the net import of carbon credits times the price of

carbon  and the net import of REDD credits times the REDD price.

12

the simulations show that the scenario with the lowest net global compliance
cost is the REDD_CUR scenario, the lowest compliance cost scenario for Annex
I is the 50% supplementarity scenario.  This is because supplementarity allows
Annex I to pay less for low-cost REDD abatement than for abatement from
other sources which receive the full international carbon price (see Figure 4).8

The economic benefit to CDM countries is significantly affected under full
REDD fungibility. Financial transfers to CDM regions decrease 34%.  The net
economic benefit (the total of the transfers less mitigation costs) declines 86%
relative to the scenario without REDD.

8   This case can arise where higher domestic abatement and CDM costs are offset by a quantity of low cost REDD units.

3.2  Results and assessment for expanded commitment scenarios

Our numerical simulation of the global compliance carbon market in the year
2020 shows, as expected, increasing carbon price and compliance costs as
increasing emissions reductions commitments are adopted.  Without
integrating REDD, the price of carbon increases from 16.0 €/tCO2 for currently
stated targets to 47.8 €/tCO2 if Annex I nations collectively cap emissions 40%
below 1990 levels.

Introduction of REDD credits to the international carbon market reduces the
price of carbon by 59% under the 25% reduction target (from 29.4 € to 11.9 €)
and by 57% under a 40% reduction target (from 47.8 € to 20.4 €).

(*)  Abatement shown versus baseline (business-as-usual)

More than 5.5 Gt of CO2
abatement is required to
reach the low end of the
IPCC recommendation
discussed in Box 1

As with our analysis of currently stated emissions reductions targets in Section
3.1, the introduction of REDD under expanded targets reduces both Annex I
domestic abatement and abatement in CDM regions.  Under the 25% reduction
target, Annex I domestic abatement drops by 53% when REDD credits enter the
market with no restrictions, while CDM abatement falls by 55%.  With a 30%
reduction target the corresponding abatement reductions are 51% and 50%
respectively.

As emissions reductions commitments deepen, both Annex I domestic
abatement and CDM abatement regain share as inexpensive REDD options are
exhausted and deforestation is virtually halted in Africa and Central America.
Under the 40% reduction scenario, both CDM and Annex I domestic abatement
are reduced by 46% with the introduction of REDD compared to the no-REDD
case.

Environmental impact

In Section 3.1 we discussed the potential environmental impact of introducing
REDD into the international carbon market from the perspective of comparative
unit quality.  Here we discuss the effectiveness of incorporating REDD into the
carbon market for reducing or halting deforestation under the various
scenarios.

Supplementarity restrictions significantly impact the amount of deforestation
which can occur through a market-based mechanism.  As seen in Figure 7, our
simulations show that nearly 82% of deforestation can be avoided in 2020 if
Annex I emissions are capped at 40% of 1990 levels and REDD credits are
accepted into the international carbon markets.  Limiting the import of REDD
units into the market to 20% of Annex I’s required reductions from baseline
results in only 16% of the baseline deforestation being avoided.

Compliance costs and financial transfers

Expanded commitments by Annex I nations are accompanied by higher
compliance costs.  This is a result of not only a greater requirement for emission
reductions, but a higher marginal cost for each unit.  Furthermore, as lower-cost
domestic abatement is exhausted, a greater percentage of emissions reductions
occur outside Annex I, resulting in significant financial transfers.

As shown in Figure 8, total Annex I compliance costs under the base case
without REDD are 41.7 billion € per year.  These costs increase more than three-
fold to 123.9 billion € with a target of 25% below 1990 levels.  At 40% below 1990
levels, compliance costs increase more than six fold to 276 billion € per year.

3.3  Sensitivity to REDD supply

The variability in the availability of REDD units is a substantial risk for
including REDD in the international carbon market.  Oversupply could collapse
prices (for example, the EU ETS experience) and affect longer term investment
in abatement programmes.  An unexpected undersupply of REDD units could
leave a large pool of demand chasing the few mitigation sources which are able
to respond to price signals, resulting in high prices.

17

€
We simulated the impact of an oversupply situation and an undersupply
situation in order to ascertain if the results were robust to these variations.  The
undersupply situation was represented in the model by reducing the supply of
REDD credits for any given price to 50% of the base amount.  The oversupply
scenario was simulated by doubling the number of units supplied at each price
for each region.

For currently stated targets, unlimited REDD trading and the high REDD credit
supply case, our simulations show a 75.7% price decrease from 16.05 €/tCO2 to
3.9 €/tCO2.   Should half as many REDD credits be delivered at a given price as
in our model, the market clearing price with REDD and currently stated targets
increases 43% from 6.2 €/tCO2 to 8.9 €/tCO2.

The large market share of REDD units, combined with the effective elasticity of
demand for REDD credits, leaves the overall market price susceptible to
significant price volatility should such large supply variations occur.

For the 40% reduction targets, unlimited REDD trading and the high REDD
credit supply case, our simulations show a 70.62% price decrease from 47.76
€/tCO2 to 14.03 €/tCO2. (an additional 31% price decrease from 20.4 €/tCO2 to
14.0 €/tCO2 compared to our base scenarios).  If half as many REDD credits are
delivered, the market clearing price with REDD and currently stated targets
increased 17% from 20.4 €/tCO2 to 24.0 €/tCO2.  The relatively small increase in
price with the lower REDD supply level is due to the fact that, under our
normal REDD supply assumptions and 40% reduction targets, deforestation
had halted in Africa and Central America leaving more expensive regions to set
the clearing price.

Partial sensitivity results are shown in Table 11 in Appendix B. Detailed
sensitivity results are available at www.kea3.com/reddmodelling.

4.  Policy Implications

Our simulation assesses a range of commitments consistent with targeting a
maximum 2°C rise in global mean temperature.  It evaluates the impact of the
integration of REDD credits into the international carbon market in the year
2020.  As we have shown in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, the anticipated supply of
REDD credits will depress global carbon prices around 60% if commitments are
not increased or if there are no supplementarity restrictions.

18

Our simulations explicitly show displacement of Annex I domestic abatement in
all scenarios where REDD is included in the market.  This displacement occurs
because REDD activities can generate credits at a lower cost than some CDM or
Annex I domestic abatement activities.  This flows through to a lower overall
carbon price.

While our model does not explicitly assess feedback effects resulting from the
inclusion of REDD in the carbon market, the predicted changes to the price of
carbon can allow us to discern at a qualitative level what some of these effects
may be.

A lower overall net abatement cost may lead to greater levels of overall
consumption relative to the base case (rebound effect) in both the developed
world (which benefits from reduced compliance costs) and the offset regions
(which benefit from increased financial inflows).  The overall net abatement cost
reduction will be partially offset by increases in agriculture and timber prices
due to restrictions on the supply of arable land and unsustainable timber
extraction as a result of REDD activity.

The reduction in global carbon price levels will reduce incentives to invest in
low emissions technology and infrastructure.  For example, the expectation of a
low carbon price could increase the attractiveness of a coal-fired power plant.
Once an investment has been made in high emissions infrastructure, capital
costs are sunk and users are likely to accept large increases in carbon prices (or
lobby against their imposition) before upgrading to cleaner technologies (lock-
in effect).

Clean technology is expected to develop faster under a high-carbon price
scenario as compared to a low carbon price scenario.   For example, the IPCC
found that in order to have a medium likelihood of staying within the 2.0-2.4°C
range (stabilisation between 445 and 490ppmv CO2-eq) the price for carbon
would need to be in the range of € 80/tCO2-eq (US$100) (IPCC AR4 WGIII, Chap
3 at 205-206).  Staying below 2°C would therefore require an even stronger
carbon price signal.

It can be expected that as clean technology evolves in the developed world it
will permeate to the developing world, leading to emissions reductions versus
the baseline.  The speed and magnitude of this transfer will vary by region and

19

technology.  The relative expense and difficulty in financing capital investments
in the developing world can slow technology transfer (Sathaye and Phadke,
2006).  On the other hand, some technologies enable less capital-intensive
development pathways and may even be adopted more readily in developing
nations.9  In either case, delayed development of clean technologies will drive
development along a higher-carbon path.

Windfall profits

The potential for REDD to generate large emissions reductions at a low cost
relative to other mitigation options will make some REDD activities highly
profitable if REDD credits are sold on the international carbon market at the
international carbon clearing price.

Figure 9 shows the size of the profits for the African rainforest region (solid
green) relative to the profits of other offset regions.  Our model shows that
Africa is the primary beneficiary of REDD because of the extensive low
marginal abatement cost opportunities there.  While an unrestricted REDD
regime would result in large profits earned by REDD nations, limiting the
REDD price through supplementarity requirements limits profits but would
result in smaller reductions in deforestation.

9 The telecommunications sector is an example of where this might occur. Developing nations moved directly to wireless
and fibre optic technologies, sidestepping expensive investments in extensive copper wire networks.  At the same time,
many developed nations still maintained existing investments their copper networks.

20

€
In our simulations, deforestation in Africa is completely halted under the 30%
and 40% reduction target scenarios that involve unrestricted REDD imports.
Continued increases in the REDD price will add to the economic benefit of the
African region without generating additional mitigation.  Mechanism designers
may seek to limit producer surplus in such situations and re-allocate resources
to other areas.

Large international transfers may lead to significant feedback effects.  As
developing nations acquire wealth, consumption may increase, resulting in an
increase in emissions within economies that are not subject to emissions caps.

Interests of purchasers and other suppliers of units

The integration of REDD units into the global carbon market in any form affects
the interests of both purchasers and other suppliers of emission units.

With the introduction of REDD into the carbon market, CDM regions face
competition for the supply of units and therefore would suffer a reduction in
net economic benefit.  Depending on the future of the CDM programme, these
losses can be sizable.  Our simulations suggest China’s loss under unlimited
REDD fungibility with stated commitments exceeds € 10 billion in 2020.

Addressing environmental concerns with REDD

If REDD mechanisms could be developed that would assure that the REDD
credits generated were environmentally equivalent to emissions reductions
from other sectors, the most economically efficient outcome would result from
unrestricted trading of REDD credits in the global carbon market.  At present,
such assurances about environmental quality of REDD credits cannot be made,
however.

Given the as-of-yet unsolved issues of leakage, permanence, and baseline
selection, conservative approaches to integrating REDD credits into the carbon
market may be preferable.

5.  Conclusion

REDD has the potential to deliver large emissions reductions and to reduce
compliance costs.  REDD also has the potential to deliver emissions reductions

21

in the short and medium term and thus is fundamental to achieving the
dramatic emissions reductions necessary by 2020.

There are several options available to policy makers for incorporating REDD in
the overall approach to combating climate change.  In this paper we evaluated
the impact in 2020 of the integration of REDD units into the international carbon
market together with emissions reductions consistent with the IPCC’s
recommendations for achieving a medium likelihood of limiting global
warming to 2°C.

Focusing on the upper end of the IPCC’s recommended emissions reductions (-
40%), we found that providing REDD unrestricted access to the carbon markets
would reduce tropical deforestation by 82% overall and reduce compliance
costs by 49%, at the cost of lowering the price of carbon by 57% percent.

In all of our simulated scenarios, the integration of unrestricted REDD credits
into the international carbon market displaces other emissions reduction
activities such as Annex I domestic abatement.  It is also likely to discourage the
development of clean technologies through a weaker price signal.

Additionally, our simulations show the unrestricted  integration of REDD will
halve the production of credits relating to energy and industrial emissions
reductions in China, India and other developing countries which could
significantly delay the deployment of clean technologies in these regions.

However, it is unclear if, in the absence of the cost-moderating effects of REDD,
the ambitious goals proposed by the IPCC will be agreed.  Significant financing
for REDD will therefore need to be raised in a manner that allows for the
maximum overall emission reductions and does not overly reduce or delay
necessary investments in clean and renewable technologies in both developed
and developing countries.

Box 2: References on the 2˚C target assumption

For the purposes of this report we have focused on a range of emissions reductions for Annex I
parties consistent with the goal of maintaining a medium likelihood of keeping the global average
temperature rise limited to 2˚C.   How do we assess what reductions are necessary to meet this goal?

-IPCC AR4, WGIII, Table SPM.5 (indicating a temperature rise of 2.0 to 2.4 for the concentration range

of 445-490ppm CO2-eq)

-IPCC AR4, WGI, Table TS.5 (Stabilization at 450 ppm CO2-eq would result in a temperature “likely

in the range” of 1.4-3.1 degrees, with a “best estimate” of 2.1 degrees rise). (see
http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ts.pdf, page 66)

-Elzen & Höhne, op. cit. (Annex I reductions of 30% and non-Annex I deviation of about 17% are

necessary for stabilization at 450ppm)

-Parry et al. 2008: Squaring up to reality. Nature. May 2008 (Reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 and

stabilizing emissions between 400-485ppm Co2-eq would provide an 80% chance of staying below 2
degrees)

-Hansen et al. Target Atmospheric CO2: Where Should Humanity Aim? (Reducing atmospheric CO2
to at least 350ppm Co2 (=445Co2-eq) is necessary to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference
with the climate)

25

- Hare, W.L., 2009.  A Safe Landing for the Climate, State of the World 2009 (Chapter 2) by The World
Watch Institute (A 2 degrees rise is not a safe level and poses dangerous anthropogenic interference
with the climate)
