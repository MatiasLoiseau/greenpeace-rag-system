export-based logging

Indeed, no independent analysis of logging operations in PNG to date
has found a company complying with the full terms and conditions of
its logging permit.

One of these issues, transfer pricing, has received regular attention in
PNG since the 1980s. Transfer pricing is a mechanism by which compa-
nies to transfer profits offshore, by declaring a sale price which is
lower than the actual price received. The result for companies is that
they can reduce or entirely eliminate their taxable profits in PNG and
hold their real profit offshore; for PNG the result is loss of foreign
currency and income.

Because transfer pricing works through the collusion of the seller and
the buyer it is impossible to prove without full documentation.
However, there are major anomalies in the trade data between PNG
and Japan that indicate the scale of illegal trade. The PNG official log
export data for 1996 shows exports of 1,390,000 m3 at an average
price of $140 per cubic metre; Japan’s records show imports from PNG
over the same period to be 1,852,000 m3 at an average price of $175
per cubic metre – a discrepancy of $130 million.

million ha per year between 1990 and 1995 – i.e. an
area the size of Belgium each year. A recent report
by the European Commission’s Joint Research
Centre attributes much of this deforestation to
excessive cutting for timber – both legal and illegal
– along with forest conversion to agricul-ture and
cash-crop plantations. While reported deforesta-
tion rates for tropical Oceania are lower at 151,000
ha per year, these forests remain under serious
threat, particularly from Malaysian logging compa-

of timber from Asia-Pacific. The USA and EU coun-
tries are also important.

20 March 2000.

More recently, in March this year, Colin Hunt of the National Research
Institute PNG wrote to the World Bank saying that there is still a “sub-
stantial discrepancy” between the export figures for PNG logs and the
corresponding import figures in Japan11. This discrepancy – of almost
US$50 per cubic metre of logs exported – could represent an estimated
loss in export earnings each year of up to $100 million.

Malaysia has already lost  85

percent of its large ancient forests.

© Greenpeace/Barrington

The few ancient forests in the countries of the Asia-Pacific

region are under threat. In Laos, Vietnam and Taiwan,

Thailand, Burma and Cambodia, at least 90 percent of large

ancient forest has already been destroyed. Malaysia has lost

85 percent, and Indonesia and Papua New Guinea have lost

72 percent and 60 percent respectively1,2. Much of this is due

to excessive cutting for timber, a high proportion of which is

illegal3. Despite claims to the contrary by the G8 govern-

ments, a significant part of the trade in illegal timber

is fuelled by demand from the international market4.

Greenpeace is calling on all governments to stop their role

in this trade.

In April this year, Greenpeace documented illegal activities in the
global timber trade in its report Against the Law: the G8 and the
illegal timber trade. The report revealed that in Asia-Pacific, illegal
practices range from logging in protected areas to mis-classifying
species in export documents. It highlighted the impact of the
region’s high levels of illegal logging on the international market5.

The response of G8 governments to the report has been to play
down the role of the international timber market in driving
demand for the illegal production and trade of wood, and to argue
that this is largely a domestic issue6. Thus, governments seek to
minimise their role in driving the illegal trade and limit their
responsibility for its environmental and social impacts.

However, such arguments are clearly inconsistent with a recent
report from the industry journal Tropical Timbers which notes
that, “At the international level, the availability of cheap, illegally
felled trees from Indonesia has led to a huge decrease in interna-
tional plywood prices.”7. Similarly, the independent environmen-
tal watchdog Global Witness reported in May this year that,
“Illegal exports to all of Cambodia’s neighbours are continuous,
whilst the logging concessionaires illegally log with impunity.”8.
These comments suggest that illegal timber is flooding the inter-
national market – far from the drop in the ocean that the G8 gov-
ernments claim.

Since the release of Against the Law, stories
of illegal logging throughout the Asia-Pacific
region have continued to hit the headlines:

Illegal logging in Indonesia is

an enormous problem with

widespread implications for the

international timber trade

Once again, Greenpeace is calling on G8 governments
to honour their commitment to combat the illegal
production and trade of wood and wood products.
It demands that these governments:

• DO NOT buy illegal timber products
• DO NOT fund forest destruction through aid for

unsustainable forestry

• DO NOT allow G8 countries to be markets for illegal

timber

• DO buy wood products from sustainable certified

forests

• DO provide urgent assistance to forest countries to

tackle illegal logging

• DO increase the capacity for monitoring and
transparency throughout the production and
transport of wood and wood products globally

Trespass and environmental crimes
(Solomon Islands)9

Illegality and logging are virtually synonymous in the
Solomon Islands. Illegalities range from invalid licences
and trespassing, to the breaching of labour conditions
and deliberate under-valuing of logs.  In addition,
although no court of law has yet found a government
minister guilty of receiving bribes from logging compa-
nies, there is ample evidence to suggest this has been
common practice.

One company at the heart of this issue is the South
Korean transnational Eagon Resources Development
Company Ltd. To date, at least six indigenous tribes have
filed legal proceedings against Eagon seeking compensa-
tion for trespass.  In 1999, the High Court delivered its
first judgement in favour of landowners, when it found
Eagon guilty of two separate counts of contempt of court.

Despite a halving of log exports since

the mid-Ninetees, logging in the

Solomon Islands is still at twice the

estimated sustainable yield.

However, claims for environmental destruction and forest
conversion are still before the Court. In an assessment
commissioned by the local Choiseul landowning tribes
and the Public Solicitor’s office, breaches by Eagon of the
terms of its licence include: harvesting of trees on land
without licence or permission; pollution of local water
sources; extraction of gravel from a sacred site for the
building of roads; illegal road construction; considerable
log waste (up to one -third left in the forest); felling of
protected tree species; lack of rehabilitation of water-
course crossings, roads and log landings; and significant
damage to burial grounds - where human remains have
been scattered by the company’s bulldozers.

Transfer pricing (Papua New Guinea)

A recent report commissioned by Greenpeace10 shows
that the PNG government has not only consistently failed
to implement existing legislation but has repeatedly bro-
ken national forestry law to allow powerful companies
access to new areas of forest. The report concludes that
illegal activity in the PNG timber industry is almost uni-
versal and includes both the irregular allocation of per-
mits and breaches of permits issued.
