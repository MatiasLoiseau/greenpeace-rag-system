1Bitcoin has emerged as a new roadblock to progress 
on addressing the climate crisis. The energy con -
sumption and carbon emissions from Bitcoin, the 
world’s largest cryptocurrency, rival those of some 
small countries, and the global machine that keeps 
it running generates air, water, and noise pollution. 
Bitcoin has also provided a much-needed lifeline to 
fossil fuels, working against progress in efforts to 
phase out coal, oil, and gas. Left unchecked, Bitcoin’s 
climate destruction is likely to accelerate. 
Despite these challenges, traditional financial ser -
vices companies continue to fuel Bitcoin’s expan -
sion by investing in Bitcoin mining companies and 
offering new investment products and services tied 
to Bitcoin. This report evaluates the role nine large financial services companies are playing in Bitcoin’s 
climate-wrecking growth and whether they are work -
ing to address Bitcoin’s pollution. All of these com -
panies have connections to Bitcoin and have failed to 
take meaningful action to solve the problem despite 
making climate and sustainability pledges. 
Our research finds that asset manager BlackRock 
and bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. are leading Bitcoin 
supporters in their respective sectors of the financial 
services industry. These companies provide a range of 
investments and services, and have done nothing to 
address Bitcoin’s impact on communities and climate. 
They have failed to acknowledge the problem and 
take responsibility for cleaning up Bitcoin.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1INTRODUCTION
Since Bitcoin (BTC) launched in 2009, the technology 
has dramatically altered the ways we interact with 
technology and finance. Today, Bitcoin poses a threat 
to our future by fueling the climate crisis.  The latest 
synthesis report from the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) warns us that limiting warming 
to 1.5°C is the safest trajectory for society, but that tar -
get is quickly slipping away and demands fundamental 
transformations of the global economy.1 Numerous 
international agencies and scientific bodies have deter -
mined that meeting the 1.5°C target will require us to 
rapidly expand renewable energy and keep fossil fuels 
in the ground.2 At this moment, Bitcoin’s large energy 
consumption is completely at odds with the dramatic 
change we need to make.
Bitcoin’s problem lies in its code.  As coded today, 
Bitcoin transactions are recorded through an ener -
gy-intensive process called proof-of-work (PoW) min -
ing. To feed the machine, Bitcoin consumes as much 
electricity as medium-sized industrialized countries 
like Sweden.3 The vast network of miners that keep 
the wheels turning have also revived decommissioned 
coal-fired and fossil fuel power plants and siphoned 
electricity from the same infrastructure that powers 
our homes. Yet, there are alternative consensus mech -
anisms that consume a mere fraction of the energy.4
Bitcoin’s energy consumption leads to increased 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  at precisely the 
moment we need to reduce them. In 2022, Bitcoin 
was estimated to produce 58 Metric tons (Mt) CO2, 
which is more than all of Chile.5 Tragically, the prob -
lem is only going to grow more severe if Bitcoin fails 
to evolve beyond PoW. Future growth in the crypto -
currency’s use and price would send Bitcoin’s energy 
consumption and carbon emissions soaring, create 
incentives for miners to seek cheap energy sources 
like coal, and roll back the hard-won progress made 
on cutting emissions . 
Against this background, Bitcoin is at an important 
crossroad. To safeguard against further climate 
destruction, it is critical that we modify Bitcoin’s 
underlying code and eliminate PoW mining.  The chal -
lenge to realizing this critical evolution of Bitcoin is 
precisely the same feature that makes it unique – it is 
a decentralized network. To adopt a new sustainable system, a diverse coalition of stakeholders, including 
financial companies and Bitcoin developers, need to 
come together, agree on the problem, and shape the 
next iteration.
To encourage this process, Greenpeace USA is focused 
on leaders in the traditional financial services sector 
who facilitate Bitcoin’s growth. The Bitcoin industry–
including the companies that operate crypto exchanges 
where people can buy, store, and sell bitcoin, and run 
industrial Bitcoin mining facilities–is dependent on 
access to traditional government-backed currencies 
and banking services. Major banks and asset managers 
have poured millions into the mining companies that 
are straining the grid and spewing pollution. Payment 
processors are driving Bitcoin’s accelerating energy 
consumption by enabling further adoption. Despite 
any progress these companies have boasted in recent 
years on reducing the climate impact of their oper -
ations and portfolios, their Bitcoin investments and 
products fall outside the boundaries of their carbon

This report investigated nine major financial insti -
tutions pulling the strings to keep the Bitcoin cli -
mate wrecking ball swinging. Our research identifies 
BlackRock as the worst contributor among asset man -
agers, which provide the most direct support to Bitcoin 
miners in the form of bonds and shareholdings as well 
as investment products and services tied to Bitcoin. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Chase) is the biggest Bitcoin 
backer within the banking sector, which provides a mix 
of mining company investment, and Bitcoin products 
and services. Among payment processors, our research 
found that both Visa and Mastercard provide substan -
tial support for broader Bitcoin adoption.
These companies have a responsibility to engage in 
future-proofing Bitcoin.  Namely, they are uniquely 
positioned to resource and support the development and implementation of an alternative consensus 
mechanism for securely validating transactions and 
maintaining Bitcoin’s digital ledger that is less ener -
gy-intensive and polluting. There is a broad menu of 
technologies to choose from and examples of other 
digital assets that have evolved beyond PoW mining 
and adopted less energy intensive systems.6 To date, 
the financial services industry has failed to acknowl -
edge responsibility for the problem. Major asset man -
agers, banks, and payment processors have put profit 
before people and the planet by turning a blind eye to 
Bitcoin’s climate impact.
The movement to Change the Code offers the finance 
industry an opportunity to lead the way in developing 
a new, cleaner future for Bitcoin.  If it successfully 
innovates, Bitcoin can join the other technologies that 
are innovating to respond to the climate crisis. If it 
fails, the technology will remain incompatible with a 
just, habitable planet for all.

1BITCOIN MINING’S ENVIRONMENTAL  
AND SOCIAL COST
Pollution and Community Harm
The process of mining Bitcoin comes with a significant 
cost to air, land, water, and community health. While 
Bitcoin proponents argue that PoW mining offers 
benefits to communities, on-the-ground realities  
have yet to deliver on the technology’s promises.7  
So, how does Bitcoin cause pollution and  
community harm?
Bitcoin is the largest and most popular digital 
cryptocurrency which works outside a centralized 
authority like a bank or government. It operates 
through a decentralized and collectively-maintained 
database, or digital ledger, that provides a record of 
all Bitcoin transactions stored on the blockchain . The 
record’s accuracy is protected through cryptography 
to prevent double counting and fraudulent 
transactions.  This process requires a mechanism  
for reaching consensus to validate transactions. 
Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism in 
which participants are committed to protecting the 
system’s integrity by putting in work, and thereby 
consuming electricity.8 Many other, and newer, 
cryptocurrencies don’t use this energy-guzzling 
process, thus, Bitcoin is far and away the biggest 
polluting cryptocurrency.9
To prove their work, miners compete to be the first 
to guess the number that completes a complex 
algorithm. The computers act like random number 
generators and those with more computing power  
can guess more numbers in less time, increasing  
their chances of winning. The winner gets to validate 
a new set, or “block,” of Bitcoin transactions that 
are added to the blockchain and is rewarded with 
transaction fees and newly generated bitcoins, or a 
“block subsidy.”10 
As Bitcoin mining has evolved, miners have expanded 
their computing power. Mining companies use 
warehouse-sized banks of specialized computers 
called application-specific integrated circuit 
(ASIC) computers designed solely to participate 
in the number guessing game. The machines are power-hungry and require resource-intensive cooling 
mechanisms. At the time of this report, Bitcoin 
mining is estimated to use more electricity than some 
entire countries, including what the Philippines and 
Sweden consumed in 2019.11 In the United States, 
the seven largest crypto mining companies use the 
same amount of electricity needed to power every 
residence in Houston, which has a population of 
2.3 million people.12 
Electronic waste from Bitcoin mining is also notable. 
The thousands of specialized Bitcoin mining computers 
only last a short time, quickly becoming obsolete in  
the competitive race to have the fastest and most 
efficient hardware, and turn into e-waste.13 Data 
is incomplete, but one estimate suggests Bitcoin 
mining generates roughly 45.51 kt of e-waste in a 
year, equivalent to the IT waste generated by the 
Netherlands.14 The comparison to other segments  
of the financial sector is difficult. What can be said 
with certainty is that fixing Bitcoin would nearly 
eliminate this e-waste entirely, reducing the volume 
of e-waste that ends up in landfills, incinerators, and 
disassembly operations that harm the poorest and 
most vulnerable communities.

1Bitcoin is a Carbon Timebomb
A substantial body of research has documented 
Bitcoin’s large and growing energy consumption.  In 
2014, the electricity needed to mine a single bitcoin 
was equal to the amount an average U.S. household 
used in 275 days. By 2022, that figure had skyrocketed 
to around nine years.15 From 2016 to 2018, researchers 
estimate that mining digital assets consumed more 
energy than the physical mining of copper, nickel, and 
gold to produce the same market value.16 
Bitcoin’s energy-hungry technology has caused 
substantial environmental and social damage.  Much 
of the electricity powering Bitcoin mines comes from 
fossil fuels, especially dirty coal. Researchers at 
Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance 
estimate that 62% of the electricity used for Bitcoin 
mining globally in 2022 came from fossil fuels  and 
coal was the largest single source. Only 26% of the 
electricity was from renewables.17 Bitcoin mining 
companies have even reopened mothballed coal-
fired power plants while others are using waste coal, 
one of the dirtiest sources of energy.18 Analysis by 
researchers at the nonprofit WattTime for a New York 
Times  investigation found that 34 large crypto mines 
in the U.S. cause nearly 16.4 million tons of carbon 
pollution each year.19
Bitcoin’s energy consumption has kept more coal 
and gas power in our energy mix, in parallel with an increasingly urgent need to hasten our transition away 
from fossil fuels.20 Bitcoin’s fossil fuel lifeline even 
extends to companies like ExxonMobil, which is exploring 
how to do Bitcoin mining at fracked oil and gas wells.21 
The connection to climate change is real. By creating 
new demand for dirty energy, Bitcoin mining is accel -
erating climate change and producing GHG emissions. 
In 2022, the global Bitcoin industry produced around 
58 Mt of CO2 annually, more than country-level 
emissions from Chile.22 And Bitcoin’s carbon footprint 
has only grown over time.  Researchers estimate that 
in 2021 mining a single bitcoin emitted 126 times the 
CO2 as a bitcoin mined in 2016.23
Much of Bitcoin’s GHG emissions originate in the 
United States, which was estimated to have almost 
40% of global Bitcoin mining computer power.24 In 2021, 
when China cracked down on Bitcoin mining, partially 
due to environmental concerns, miners relocated to 
other parts of the world.25 Places with cheap fossil 
fuels took on a greater share of global mining opera -
tions, including Kazakhstan, parts of the former Soviet 
Republic, and the United States. The net impact seems 
to be that Bitcoin’s carbon intensity increased.26 In the 
United States alone, the CO2 emissions from Bitcoin 
mining facilities is equivalent to adding 7.5 million 
vehicles to American roadways.27 Yet, information on 
the location and energy sources of Bitcoin mining facil -
ities is hard to find, pointing to the need for increased 
disclosures and transparency in the industry.

1Riot Platforms: The Biggest Carbon Emitter 
Of the Bitcoin mining companies in this report, 
Riot Platforms is a leading recipient of invest -
ment dollars from banks and asset managers 
— over $700 million from Vanguard, BlackRock, 
Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs 
Group, and Citigroup. Vanguard and BlackRock 
are the company’s two largest shareholders, with 
combined holdings of about one third of shares.
These investments support an energy and subsidy-  
guzzling facility. Riot’s facility in Rockdale, Texas 
is the largest carbon emitter and energy user 
among U.S.-based Bitcoin mines, according to a 
New York Times  investigation.28 The mine is esti -
mated to consume as much electricity as 300,000 
surrounding homes. Analysis by the nonprofit 
WattTime found that the facility emitted 1.918 
million tons of CO2 per year and 96% of its 
energy demand was met by fossil fuels. 
Riot has even found a way to get paid by Texas 
ratepayers through a program called Responsive 
Reserve Service that pays large energy users 
to use less energy or shut-off during periods of 
peak demand. Through this program, it can be 
more profitable for Riot to turn-off its computers 
than mine Bitcoin.29 In 2022, Riot made nearly 
$9.3 million from the program.30
Residents in Navarro County, TX, have organized 
against Riot Platforms to stop the miner from 
consuming massive amounts of electricity, 
increasing rates for water and electricity for 
residents, increasing air pollution, and causing 
excessive noise pollution.31If we fail to fix Bitcoin, its energy consumption will 
continue to grow, particularly as large financial com -
panies further enable its wider adoption and push 
more miners into this lucrative guessing game. The 
industry’s emissions will continue to take us in the 
wrong direction and further complicate efforts to 
avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis. 
Given the magnitude of Bitcoin’s energy consumption 
and the potential for it to grow rapidly as Bitcoin 
adoption scales, simply converting the Bitcoin mining 
industry to renewable energy will not suffice. We need 
to reduce energy demand to defuse this carbon time 
bomb before it detonates by changing Bitcoin’s con -
sensus mechanism. 
Bitcoin Losing Its  
Social License
Because of Bitcoin mining’s excessive energy con -
sumption, some countries  have banned mining and 
several U.S. states are considering stricter regulations. 
Before implementing a ban on Bitcoin mining in 2021, 
China hosted the largest crypto mining industry in 
the world.33 Iceland, where geothermal energy had 
initially attracted miners, placed a moratorium on new 
facilities.34 Sweden and Norway recently increased tax 
rates for Bitcoin miners making it largely unprofitable 
to mine.35 In the United States, the New York state 
government passed a two-year moratorium on new 
crypto mining facilities operating behind-the-meter 
with fossil fuels.36
At the local level, communities are resisting Bitcoin 
mining companies that try to hang a shingle in their 
backyards.  Air, water, and noise pollution drive a 
wedge between the miners and their communities 
and feed local resistance .37 Communities across the 050100150200250300350

United States living near Bitcoin mines have com -
plained about the constant noise from the 24-hour 
operations.38 Other damages include water pollution 
from water withdrawal and discharge for power plant 
operations and cooling mining facilities, solid waste 
from burning fossil fuels, and land use changes from 
the construction of these industrial operations.39
The problem is especially dire where mines are pow -
ered by coal-fired and fossil gas power plants. Coal 
combustion produces fine particles of sulfur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxides, and other air toxins. These local 
impacts can also worsen existing environmental injus -
tices burdening neighboring communities.40 
Stronghold Digital Mining, a company in which Fidelity, 
Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Vanguard hold shares, 
purchased two waste coal-fired power plants in 
Pennsylvania that had been operating inconsistently 
but are now running regularly to power Bitcoin min -
ing.41 Waste coal is one of the dirtiest forms of energy. 
According to U.S. Energy Information Administration 
data from 2021, Pennsylvania’s waste-coal-fired power 
plants had average CO2 emissions of over 2,760 pounds per megawatt-hour (MWh), one of the most 
carbon intensive fuel sources.42 Nearby residents are 
also exposed to hazardous air pollutants, including 
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, and safety risks from large 
trucks carrying waste coal on small country roads 
to the plant.43 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) data shows that the company’s operations have 
increased sulfur dioxide emissions by 351% and nitro -
gen oxides by 1,224% in 2022 compared to 2020 levels. 
The waste coal-fueled operations released over 1.4 
million tons of carbon dioxide in 2022.44

1The growth of Bitcoin and the recent boom of U.S. 
Bitcoin mining relies on the money and support of 
major financial services companies. Energy-intensive 
and volatile Bitcoin is adding to the climate crisis and 
putting everyday Americans’ financial security at risk 
while big investors and corporations reap the rewards 
of Bitcoin’s expansion.46 Researchers have found that 
increased demand for Bitcoin leads to environmental 
degradation.47 Yet these same financial companies 
have pledges to reduce GHG emissions and the 
environmental impacts of business operations. Bitcoin 
investments are a barrier to achieving these goals and 
need to be addressed as part of companies’ sustain -
ability plans.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were created as alterna -
tives to the traditional economic system but are now 
intertwined with large, mainstream financial com -
panies in many different ways.  Asset managers and 
banks are investing and providing financial services 
for Bitcoin mining companies – supporting the facil -
ities that drive Bitcoin’s fossil fuel consumption and 
contribute to its carbon footprint. Bitcoin mining has 
become big business, with large publicly-traded com -
panies dominating the sector. According to JP Morgan 
Chase & Co. (Chase) analysts, U.S.-listed Bitcoin min -
ers had a total market cap of $7.3 billion as of April 
14, 2023, and were dominant players in Bitcoin mining, 
collecting an estimated 73% of the annual rewards 
from adding blocks to the blockchain and represent -
ing 21% of the global network hashrate (a measure of 
computing power deployed for Bitcoin mining).48
Large financial services companies are also creating 
more ways for individual and institutional investors 
to put their money into Bitcoin. This includes funds 
tracking the crypto industry, crypto exchanges that 
let customers buy, sell, and store bitcoin, and tools 
for trading bitcoin futures and derivatives. Payment 
processing companies like Visa and Mastercard are 
also making it possible for people to buy things with 
bitcoin, and developing software and services to help 
banks support cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (see 
section on payment processors for more details). 
However, unlike companies such as Tesla, which owns $184 million worth of bitcoin, these mainstream 
financial corporations appear to have no direct bitcoin 
holdings.49
While these companies invest in carbon-intensive 
Bitcoin, they have made pledges to reduce carbon 
emissions and plans to increase corporate sustain -
ability. With the exception of Fidelity and Vanguard, 
the companies Greenpeace USA surveyed for this 
report have net zero emissions pledges and claim to 
support the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. 
Many have joined global initiatives like the Glasgow 
Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), and the sec -
tor-specific United Nations Net Zero Banking or Asset 
Owner Alliance.50 Financial companies are beginning 
to disclose GHG emissions from business operations 
and even from investments. Yet, the leaders of these 
companies continue to expand into Bitcoin without 
acknowledging Bitcoin’s pollution and contribution to 
the climate crisis. 
Companies have known about this problem for 
years. In 2017, Mastercard stated in its Corporate 
Sustainability Report that “new research shows that 
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are inherently more ener -
gy-intensive than Mastercard’s payment network.”51 
Analysts from Citigroup published a report document -
ing Bitcoin’s high energy use and warned that the 
carbon emissions could spark regulatory scrutiny.52 
With increased scrutiny from regulators and custom -
ers, the head-in-the-sand approach will not work for 
long. Major financial services companies expanding 
into Bitcoin will have to deal with the growing climate 
risk on corporate balance sheets. Extreme weather, 
which is getting more frequent and intense with 
climate change, is a material risk to Bitcoin mining 
operations. For example, ice storms in Texas and 
increasingly severe hurricanes in the Gulf Coast can 
disrupt energy supplies and directly damage mining 
facilities.53 Heat waves and cold snaps can increase 
energy costs, leading miners to curtail and shutdown 
their operations.54 The massive 750-megawatt capac -
ity Riot Platforms mine in Rockdale, Texas had to shut 
down for weeks following damage to equipment from 
a series of extreme winter weather events.55 BIG FINANCE AND BITCOIN’S

1Policymakers are starting to take notice and have 
proposed a range of laws, taxes, and regulations that 
would require the industry to report its carbon emis -
sions and pay for its energy appetite. For example, 
the Biden administration proposed an excise tax on 
electricity used by crypto miners.56 Considering their 
already razor-thin margins, the 30% increase to min -
ers’ major operating expense would be a significant 
blow, concluded analysts with crypto-intelligence 
firm Coin Metrics.57 In 2023, U.S. Senator Edward 
Markey re-introduced the Crypto-Asset Environmental 
Transparency Act,  which would require Bitcoin mining 
companies to disclose GHG emissions and direct the 
EPA to study the impacts of Bitcoin mining.58
Evaluating Corporate Bitcoin 
Connections
To hold the financial sector to account on its climate 
pledges and to encourage greater responsibility for 
Bitcoin’s pollution, this report evaluates companies’ 
ties to Bitcoin and the extent to which those compa -
nies are acknowledging and addressing the problem 
in line with sustainability initiatives. We examined 
companies in three sectors that play a critical role in 
Bitcoin’s expansion: banks (Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, 
and JP Morgan Chase), asset managers (BlackRock, 
Fidelity, and Vanguard)59, and payment processors 
(American Express, Mastercard, and Visa). Within each 
sector we selected the three largest U.S.-based com -
panies that are the most active in Bitcoin and assess 
the Bitcoin-related investments and services offered, 
contrasted with corporate climate and sustainabil -
ity pledges. We evaluated companies on the extent 
of Bitcoin investment and services, the strength 
of climate commitments and emissions reduction 
pledges, and the level of acknowledgment and action 
to address Bitcoin’s climate and community impacts. 
We collected data on the following types of invest -
ments and exposure to Bitcoin: 
 ◼Providing and supporting investment prod -
ucts tied to Bitcoin
 ◼Investing in Bitcoin mining companies through 
shareholding, bondholding, lending, and un -
derwriting ◼Partnering with and investing in crypto com -
panies that provide vital services for Bitcoin 
like wallets, exchanges, and data analytics 
 ◼Supporting payments and transactions 
using bitcoin
 ◼Providing consulting, data, and research 
services related to Bitcoin
 ◼Corporate ownership of bitcoin
We also reviewed company ESG (environmental, 
social, and governance) efforts and actions on climate 
change, including:
 ◼Company sustainability and climate reports, 
including net zero pledges
 ◼ESG and sustainability scores from indus -
try-leading measures including MSCI and 
Standard and Poor’s (S&P)
 ◼Membership in national and international 
groups and alliances on climate change and 
sustainability
We assessed the strength of corporate climate and 
sustainability plans, primarily if the company has 
a net zero pledge and is a member of the Glasgow 
Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), and the asso -
ciated groups for banks and asset managers. GFANZ 
was formed to ensure the financial industry worked 
to meet the goals of the UN Paris Climate agree -
ment, particularly limiting global warming to 1.5 C. We 
find that the stronger corporate climate pledges are 
aligned with reducing emissions to meet a 1.5 C target 
and have a deadline of reaching net zero company 
emissions by 2050 or earlier. 60
Finally, we evaluated companies based on their 
acknowledgement and action to solve Bitcoin’s cli -
mate problem. GPUS reached out to representatives 
of the nine companies and asked about their Bitcoin 
investments and awareness of the climate impacts. 
We requested companies make a statement about 
Bitcoin’s pollution and support action to decarbonize 
Bitcoin. We also reviewed company websites, press 
releases, and documents related to Bitcoin and 
crypto to see if they discussed environmental and 
energy issues.

Failing on Climate
We find that these stalwarts of the mainstream finan -
cial industry are expanding into Bitcoin by investing 
in Bitcoin mining companies, and creating new ser -
vices and partnerships to enable investments and 
transactions in bitcoin. All nine companies have ties 
to Bitcoin and are involved in various activities that 
help grow and mainstream Bitcoin which will mean 
more energy use and GHG emissions. BlackRock and 
Chase stand out within the asset manager and banks 
categories, respectively, for Bitcoin exposure in sharp 
contradiction to corporate climate pledges. 
As a class, asset managers are the Bitcoin mining 
industry’s largest backers, mainly in the form of signif -
icant shareholdings in mining companies. BlackRock 
stands out as a laggard given its mining industry 
investments combined with a range of services and 
investment products related to Bitcoin. Vanguard and 
Fidelity are also betting big on Bitcoin and offer myr -
iad investment and trading services linked to Bitcoin 
alongside their shareholdings in mining companies. 
Among the banks, our research identifies Chase as a 
key laggard. Its Bitcoin mining company investments 
total more than $25 million and it offers a range of 
investment products and services tied to Bitcoin. 
Although Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been critical 
of Bitcoin publicly,61 the bank has yet to comment on 
Bitcoin’s environmental impact and Dimon’s critical 
remarks belie the tangible 
support Chase is providing to 
Bitcoin. Goldman Sachs has a 
comparable investment inter -
est, but is found to perform 
slightly better in our assess -
ment given a smaller breadth of 
Bitcoin products and services. 
Finally, the research finds 
payment processing companies 
primarily support Bitcoin by 
offering credit and debit cards 
that facilitate bitcoin trans -
actions. Visa and Mastercard 
are found to be expanding 
crypto-related services and 
partnerships that likely have 
connections to Bitcoin. All of these companies are failing to address Bitcoin’s 
pollution. Financial companies’ Bitcoin exposure 
demonstrates disregard for the harm to the planet and 
communities caused by Bitcoin’s further expansion. 
None of the companies have adequately acknowledged 
Bitcoin’s climate problem or supported meaningful 
solutions. Some companies appear to be aware of 
Bitcoin’s problematic energy use but have not clearly 
stated the problem to the public or taken any respon -
sibility. However, in an important initial step, several 
companies, including Visa, Mastercard, and Citi, have 
started engaging with GPUS on the issue. Mastercard 
has expressed support for  “energy-efficient solutions 
that consider climate and community impacts.”62

1Section 1: Asset Managers
Asset management companies provide essential 
funding to Bitcoin mining companies and create 
investment products that enable customers to bet on 
the price of bitcoin.  The trillions of dollars controlled 
by asset managers play a huge role in how people and 
companies invest and save money, and can shape the 
direction of the economy. Therefore, these companies 
hold a critical responsibility for Bitcoin’s expansion 
and its climate impacts. 
Publicly-traded Bitcoin mining companies rely on equity 
offerings to raise capital, which depends on getting 
large investors and mutual funds to invest. Without 
support from these big money managers, the compa -
nies that mine, sell, and trade bitcoin would struggle to 
operate. Plus, it would be riskier and more challenging 
for individuals to invest in bitcoin without trusted and 
reputable companies moving into the industry. 
Our research examined Bitcoin ties among the three 
largest U.S. asset managers, BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity. In 2021, financial news outlets noticed 
that large asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and 
Vanguard were buying stocks in crypto mining com -
panies.64 BlackRock stands out for having the second 
largest shareholdings in Bitcoin mining among the 
three asset managers and breadth of Bitcoin-related 
investment services. Fidelity has smaller sharehold -
ings in mining companies, but was an early Bitcoin 
adopter and now offers a wide-range of investment 
services and products tied to bitcoin that are helping 
it become more mainstream. Vanguard is the most 
cautious about crypto investment services, but none -
theless, is the largest shareholder in Bitcoin mining 
companies among the companies we researched. 
On climate, Fidelity and Vanguard are laggards. They 
do not have concrete net zero pledges and have 
backtracked on their own climate commitments. 
BlackRock, on the other hand, seeks to be a leader 
on climate.65 Yet none have directly acknowledged 
Bitcoin’s pollution or been willing to engage with 
GPUS to solve the problem.

1BlackRock
BlackRock is one of the largest asset managers in the 
world, with $8.6 trillion in assets under management 
serving retail and institutional clients.66 The company 
is rolling out various Bitcoin-related products and 
services that enable clients to buy and sell bitcoin. 
The company also has investments in Bitcoin mining 
and crypto industry companies. 
BlackRock is expanding into Bitcoin despite the 2022 
crypto winter and high-profile collapses and fraudu -
lent activities in the sector. In his 2023 annual letter 
to shareholders, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink highlighted 
his optimism for crypto while also pointing out that 
it carries risk. “At BlackRock we continue to explore 
the digital assets ecosystem, especially areas most 
relevant to our clients such as permissioned block -
chains and tokenization of stocks and bonds. While 
the industry is maturing, there are clearly elevated 
risks and a need or regulation in this market.”67 While 
Fink recognizes the need for regulation, the company 
is still expanding into the sector while not addressing 
Bitcoin’s pollution.
BlackRock offers numerous ways for clients to invest 
in Bitcoin. In August 2022, the company made a sig -
nificant move into crypto by offering its first direct 
bitcoin investment product – a private bitcoin trust 
for institutional investors tied to the price of Bitcoin.68 
BlackRock’s new partnership with Coinbase, the larg -
est crypto-trading platform in the United States, will 
make it easier for institutional investors to manage 
and trade bitcoin.69 The service will allow clients to 
manage their bitcoin alongside their other public and 
private investments.70 In 2021, BlackRock filed docu -
ments with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) to include bitcoin futures as eligible investments 
for two funds, the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, 
and the BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities 
Portfolio.71 A subsequent SEC filing showed that the 
BlackRock Global Allocation Fund held 37 bitcoin 
futures contracts with the CME. BlackRock also offers 
investment funds that track the broader crypto and 
web3 sectors including the iShares Future Metaverse 
Tech and Communications ETF (MTAV) that tracks 
companies related to the metaverse,72 and the iShares 
Blockchain and Tech ETF (IBLC) that tracks compa -
nies connected to blockchain technologies – the fund 
had a $6.5 million market value as of Q2 2023.73 In 
June 2023, shortly before this report’s publication, BlackRock requested approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF 
from the SEC which contibuted to a spike in Bitcoin’s 
price.74
The company has investments in Bitcoin miners and 
crypto-related companies through its institutional 
investments and various investment funds. BlackRock 
invests in publicly-traded Bitcoin mining companies 
through direct ownership of shares and the holdings 
of ETFs, mutual funds, and other types of funds. Our 
research finds that BlackRock has shareholdings in 
18 Bitcoin mining companies that are valued at over 
$595 million, the second largest among the compa -
nies we studied.75 For example, the BlackRock Small 
Cap Index VI Fund holds TeraWulf stock. 
We can draw a direct line from BlackRock’s Bitcoin 
mining investments to the revival of fossil fuel infra -
structure. BlackRock controls nearly 6% of Greenidge 
Generation Holdings’ stock and is the largest institu -
tional shareholder. Greenidge converted a closed coal 
power plant to fossil gas in upstate New York to directly 
power a Bitcoin mine that has faced scrutiny from reg -
ulators and the public for its pollution.76 BlackRock also 
holds $2.8 million worth of bonds in Marathon Digital.77 
After the Bitcoin mining company Core Scientific Inc. 
filed for bankruptcy in 2022, BlackRock was among 
a group of creditors that lent the company about 
$500 million by purchasing secured convertible notes. 
BlackRock accounted for $38 million and contributed 
another $17 million to a loan enabling the company to 
operate during bankruptcy.78 Arcane Research found 
that BlackRock held 15.2% of shares in MicroStrategy, 
a company with large bitcoin holdings, which indirectly 
exposes BlackRock to Bitcoin.79 BlackRock also had 
extensive holdings in Silvergate, the crypto-focused 
bank that collapsed in April 2023.80 
Climate
BlackRock’s Bitcoin offerings are in sharp contra -
diction with the company’s efforts to be a financial 
sector leader on climate and ESG. The company 
publicly supports action on climate change, and 
environmentally and socially-conscious investments, 
especially funding energy transitions. BlackRock has 
an A ESG rating from MSCI and the S&P Global ESG 
ranking places the company at 93, higher than the 
banks we examined. BlackRock is a signatory to the 
Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which includes

1pledging to support net zero emissions by 2050 in 
line with efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. BlackRock 
is purportedly committed to investing in line with net 
zero emissions by 2050 and developing science based 
emissions reductions targets.81 However, the com -
pany’s net zero plan has not been validated by the 
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). 
BlackRock also promotes reporting of emissions 
as a member of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and a signatory to the 
UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment. The com -
pany joined Climate Action 100+, a group of investors 
that engages with companies to improve climate 
disclosure and align business strategy with the goals of the Paris Agreement.82 Yet, those disclosures have 
not incorporated emissions from Bitcoin.
BlackRock’s executives have not made a public state -
ment about Bitcoin’s pollution and have not been 
willing to engage in conversation with GPUS. Yet, there 
is evidence that the company is aware that Bitcoin 
and PoW cryptocurrencies have a climate problem. 
BlackRock expressed support for efforts by the non -
profits RMI and Energy Web to create more transpar -
ency about sustainable energy use in Bitcoin mining.83 
Thus, BlackRock has signaled support for at least 
some solutions to clean up Bitcoin, despite failing to 
acknowledge responsibility and take more meaningful 
action toward a code change.

1Fidelity Investments
Fidelity Investments is one of the largest asset man -
agers in the world, with over $10 trillion in assets 
under management and around 40 million custom -
ers.84 The company has extensive mutual fund and 
401(k) retirement plan offerings, and many Americans 
rely on Fidelity for their retirement savings. Fidelity 
was one of the first traditional finance companies to 
dive into the crypto sector and now offers many ways 
for institutional, private, and retail investors to invest 
in Bitcoin. Fidelity lends crypto a sense of trust and 
reputability while making it easier for casual investors 
to bet on Bitcoin, which is critical for its growth.
In 2014, Abigail Johnson took the helm of the private 
company founded by her grandfather and pushed the 
company into crypto. Johnson had been involved with 
Bitcoin mining for some time. “I really wanted to do 
mining because I wanted us to understand the whole 
ecosystem, I wanted us to have a seat at the table 
with people who were really driving things and under -
stand the full stack,” Johnson said in a 2022 interview 
with Forbes.85 She now speaks at crypto conferences 
and advocates for integrating cryptocurrencies like 
Bitcoin into the mainstream financial sector. Despite 
its fluctuations, instability, and scandals, Johnson 
continues to position crypto as part of Fidelity’s long-
term strategy.86 
In 2018, the company launched its Fidelity Digital 
Assets unit, which focuses on institutional crypto 
investments and services. By 2022, the unit had 
scaled to around 500 employees.87 Initially, it offered 
crypto trading and custody for institutions – securely 
storing investors’ assets like bitcoin.88 It has since 
expanded its service offerings.89 Bloomberg describes 
it as one of the most visible institutional advocates 
for crypto investing.90 
In a move that could bring Bitcoin investing to mil -
lions of Americans, Fidelity is letting employers with 
401(k) plans give employees the option to direct 
some of their savings into Bitcoin, up to a 20% cap.91 
This is a big move toward integrating Bitcoin into the 
retirement savings of people who otherwise would 
not have ventured into crypto investments. This move 
sparked concern from regulators and several U.S. sen -
ators wrote letters of concern to the company.92 The Department of Labor (DOL) issued guidance suggest -
ing 401(k) retirement plans stay away from speculative 
and volatile crypto investments.93
In March 2023, the company launched its own Bitcoin 
trading and custody program for retail customers 
called “Fidelity Crypto.”94 This launch marks the first 
time a major financial institution got involved in 
directly trading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, 
and could compete with exchanges run by crypto-
focused companies like Coinbase.95 
Fidelity also offers ways for clients to invest in Bitcoin 
and Bitcoin-related companies through various funds. 
The company is the first large asset manager to issue 
a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) linked to the 
price of Bitcoin, the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF 
(FBTC) that is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.96 
Fidelity applied to the SEC for a similar Bitcoin ETF in 
the United States but it was rejected due to concerns 
about fraud and manipulation.97 FBTC currently holds 
1590.19 bitcoin which was valued at around $44.8 mil -
lion in April 2023.98 Fidelity’s All-in-One Balanced ETF 
also held $1.7 million worth of bitcoin as of December 
31, 2022.99 Fidelity also manages funds that invest 
in the broader crypto industry, including the Fidelity 
Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (FDIG).
Fidelity holds substantial stock in publicly-traded 
Bitcoin mining companies through ETFs, mutual 
funds, and direct investments, although less than 
fellow asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard. Our 
research found that Fidelity has shareholdings in 22 
Bitcoin mining companies, valued at over $86.7 million, 
including Hut 8 and Marathon Digital.100 Through several 
funds, Fidelity also holds about $500,000 of bonds in 
Greenidge Generation whose Bitcoin mine powered by 
a fossil gas plant in upstate New York has been subject 
to multiple lawsuits over environmental violations.101 
Fidelity also invests in companies that provide ser -
vices, like software and analytics, for the crypto 
sector. For example, in May 2021, Fidelity invested in 
Talos, a firm that provides companies with software 
for crypto trading.102 In 2021, Fidelity was an investor 
in a $600 million funding round for Stripe, the pay -
ment and transaction software company active in 
supporting crypto.103

1While Fidelity does not appear to own bitcoin directly, 
the company does have Bitcoin exposure through 
its 7.3% stake in MicroStrategy, which is the largest 
corporate holder of bitcoin and led by a vocal Bitcoin 
proponent, CEO Michael Saylor. Microstrategy was 
one of the first large companies to state it would 
offer Bitcoin investments to employees through their 
Fidelity 401(k) plan.
Climate
Fidelity is a laggard on climate and ESG within the 
financial sector. The company has not joined the 
Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), and 
executives have said they do not want to commit 
to the net zero by 2050 targets.104 Still, Fidelity has  
sustainability goals and reports on environmental and 
climate issues. Fidelity is a signatory to the United 
Nations Principles for Responsible Investment and 
claims to support the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures’ recommendations. Fidelity’s statement of sustainability intent emphasizes 
how the company will address energy consumption 
and other sustainability issues in corporate-owned 
buildings. The company claims to be in the early stages 
of adopting sustainability approaches throughout their 
business, including fund operations, products, risk 
management, and procurement.105 In Fidelity’s 2021 
Environmental Report, company climate change goals 
are described as continuing “to reduce our green -
house gas emissions by expanding use of renewable 
energy, with a dedicated focus on reducing carbon. 
At the same time, to build climate resilience, we are 
proactively planning for the increasing unpredictability 
of climate variability and long-term climate change.” 
Yet, Fidelity has not set transparent and accountable 
emissions reduction targets or net zero pledges.
Fidelity has not acknowledged Bitcoin’s pollution or its  
exposure to Bitcoin-related emissions. Company rep -
resentatives have declined GPUS requests to meet and 
discuss the issue, and the company shows no signs of  
working to create a solution to Bitcoin’s climate problem.

1Vanguard
Vanguard is one of the world’s largest asset man -
agement companies. It provides investment and 
advisory services, and serves a range of clients, 
including institutions, individuals, and mutual funds. 
The company has around $8.5 trillion in assets under 
management and offers 215 U.S.-based funds and 205 
funds outside the United States.106 Vanguard’s lead -
ers have publicly expressed hesitancy about crypto 
as an investment, and the company has not created 
investment products directly tied to Bitcoin or other 
cryptocurrencies. However, Vanguard and its many 
investment funds have extensive shareholdings in 
Bitcoin mining companies, helping finance the facil -
ities that consume large amounts of electricity and 
have large carbon emissions.
In 2017, Vanguard founder, Jack Bogle, commented 
that investors should “avoid Bitcoin like the plague” 
during a presentation at the Council on Foreign 
Relations.107 In 2018, Vanguard chairman Will McNabb 
expressed skepticism about cryptocurrency, partic -
ularly due to speculation and “idiosyncratic risk.”108 
Unlike other asset managers, Vanguard does not offer 
ETFs focused on the crypto sector. In 2022 the com -
pany stopped letting clients purchase shares of the 
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, one of the first securities tied 
to the price of Bitcoin and a popular way to indirectly 
invest in Bitcoin.109 
Yet, Vanguard does have exposure to Bitcoin. The 
company holds shares in many of the large publicly 
traded Bitcoin mining companies through its invest -
ment advising, institutional holdings, and mutual funds. 
According to our research, Vanguard holds stock in 17 
Bitcoin mining companies, with shares representing 
over $615 million – making Vanguard the largest inves -
tor in public mining companies among the large asset 
managers and banks we analyzed.110 Vanguard also has investments in other compa -
nies tied to the Bitcoin industry. The company had 
invested in Silvergate, the crypto-friendly bank that 
collapsed in early 2023.111 In December 2022, Vanguard 
had indirect exposure to bitcoin through its 8.43% 
stake in leading bitcoin holder MicroStrategy.112 
Vanguard also uses blockchain technology, which 
means the company has a stake in ensuring its prod -
ucts and services rely on a consensus mechanism that 
does not pollute and contribute to the climate crisis, 
unlike Bitcoin’s. In 2017, Vanguard said it was develop -
ing the use of blockchain technology to update data for 
mutual funds, including some of the company’s largest 
funds.113 By 2019, this system was in operation, making 
Vanguard one of the first major financial institutions to 
use blockchain for a core business service. 
Climate
Vanguard is a laggard on climate action within the 
finance sector and has not made the net zero pledges 
necessary to avert the worst of the climate crisis. In 
December 2022, the company dropped out of the UN 
Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.114 Instead of mak -
ing firm commitments to reduce emissions, Vanguard 
claims to be working on climate disclosures and get -
ting companies they invest in to report GHG emissions. 
While Vanguard has some ESG focused funds, they 
offer fewer than other asset managers like BlackRock. 
According to research and analytics firm Morningstar, 
Vanguard has only 28 sustainable funds with assets of 
$33.9 billion compared to BlackRock with 282 sustain -
able funds with assets of $270 billion .115
Vanguard has not acknowledged Bitcoin’s climate 
problem or the company’s role in the issue, and has 
not applied GHG reporting and disclosure require -
ments to Bitcoin mining companies. Leaders from 
Vanguard have declined requests to meet with

1Section 2: Banks
By facilitating bitcoin investments and transac -
tions, banks play a vital role in the functioning of the 
Bitcoin industry and its expansion. Banks also pro -
vide the funding and financial services necessary for 
Bitcoin mining companies to operate.  
Retail and investment banks are creating programs 
and services that let institutional and individual 
clients buy and store bitcoin, helping mainstream the 
cryptocurrency. Commercial and investment banks 
are also vital for crypto companies that need access 
to capital to grow and a way to move bitcoin to and 
from US Dollars. Crypto exchange companies and 
Bitcoin miners need to pay employees and rent in US 
Dollars, and move clients’ crypto holdings to and from 
US Dollars to facilitate transitions and payments. 
Thus,  Bitcoin would struggle without access to the 
mainstream banking system.116 Many of the largest banks are expanding their Bitcoin 
interests. Our research focused on three of the largest 
U.S. banks (Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Chase) that 
are also the most active in offering Bitcoin products, 
services, and investments. 
All three banks offer some type of Bitcoin investment 
product, and have invested in Bitcoin mining and crypto 
companies. Chase offers Bitcoin trading services to 
clients and, like Goldman, has over $25 million worth of 
shareholdings in Bitcoin mining companies.117 Goldman 
Sachs created a dedicated crypto trading desk and is 
creating new ways to integrate Bitcoin into investing.118 
While Citi has the least shareholdings in mining com -
panies, the bank has helped several mining companies 
raise capital and offers some Bitcoin-related trading 
services.119 At the same time, these companies all have 
net zero pledges but have not reconciled those with 
Bitcoin’s emissions. Citi has taken an initial step of 
engaging with GPUS to discuss the issue.

1Citigroup
Citigroup is a large banking and financial services 
company with over $2.4 trillion in assets and nearly 
$15 billion of income in 2022.120 Since 2021, Citi has 
been expanding its presence in the crypto sector. The 
company is reportedly developing new services to 
facilitate Bitcoin investment by providing trading and 
other services which could make it easier to buy and 
sell bitcoin.121 Citi also has investments that support 
Bitcoin mining companies.
In 2021, Citi announced that it would offer bitcoin 
futures trading for some institutional clients.122 That 
same year, Citi’s Global Wealth Investments arm 
formed a Digital Assets Group to expand into crypto.123 
News outlets also reported that Citi hired 100 people 
to work in a blockchain and digital assets division.124 
Citi is also developing crypto services for markets 
outside of the United States. Citi’s Securities Services 
team is also partnering with Swiss crypto firm Metaco 
to build Citi’s digital asset custody capabilities, basi -
cally secure accounts to store digital assets that 
could include cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Eventually 
clients might be able to keep their bitcoin in a Citi 
account rather than a wallet run by a crypto-specific 
company.125
Citi has helped several Bitcoin mining companies raise 
capital through underwriting. Citi was an advisor for 
an initial public offering (IPO) by Canaan Inc., a pro -
ducer of ASICS for Bitcoin mining that is expanding 
into the operation of mining facilities.126 In October 
2019, the IPO raised $90 million.127 Citi controlled 
54.35% of the deal with 5.43 million shares priced at 
$9 per share and earned an estimated $3.91 million 
in fees.128 Citi was also the sole manager of a private 
placement of $500 million in notes for Galaxy Digital 
Holdings, a crypto investment and Bitcoin min -
ing company, on November 29, 2021. Galaxy Digital 
intended to use the capital to fund growth initia -
tives.129 Later in 2022, the company bought a mining 
facility in Texas.130 While Citi is not a large shareholder 
in Bitcoin mining companies, the company does hold 
shares of ten miners worth about $125,000 including 
Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain.131 Climate
Citi has pledged to act on climate change and to 
align its business with environmental sustainability 
and social responsibility. Citi is a founding member 
of the UN’s Net Zero Banking Alliance and has joined 
the RMI Center for Climate Aligned Finance and the 
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). 
The bank has committed to reaching net zero in com -
pany financing by 2050 and in operations by 2030.132 
Citi has an A (out of a possible AAA) ESG rating from 
MSCI, a company that provides industry-leading ESG 
assessments, and has an 81 ranking by the S&P Global 
ESG ranking, another commonly used assessment, 
which is below the global median for peer companies 
but similar to other large U.S. banks. Citi has issued 
reports following recommendations by the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a 
global organization that sets guidelines for volun -
tary climate-related financial risk disclosures, since 
2018. Citi is also a signatory to the U.N. Environment 
Program’s Principles for Responsible Banking.133 
Citi releases data on the company’s investments 
in carbon-intensive sectors and scope 1, 2, and 3 
emissions.134 However, the company is not following 
science-based emissions targets, as defined by the 
SBTi, which are necessary for creating rigorous and 
verifiable pathways to net zero. 
While Citi appears to know Bitcoin has an energy 
problem, the company continues to expand its offer -
ings while remaining silent about its responsibility. 
Citi’s climate disclosures and emissions reduction 
plans have not included Bitcoin. Yet, in 2021, Citi ana -
lysts published a report documenting Bitcoin’s grow -
ing energy use and warned that the carbon emissions 
would likely meet public and regulatory scrutiny. The 
report highlighted how Bitcoin’s energy consumption 
would accelerate alongside its price.135 While com -
pany leaders have met with GPUS and expressed a 
willingness to engage the issue, Citi has not publicly 
acknowledged the emissions from Bitcoin-related 
investments and services nor taken action to address 
the problem.

1Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs is the second largest investment bank 
in the world, with a market cap of around $115 billion.136 
Goldman’s embrace of crypto is a powerful signal of 
Wall Street’s acceptance. The company is investing 
in Bitcoin related companies, offering new Bitcoin 
investment services and products, and taking steps 
towards integrating Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into 
the mainstream financial industry. The crypto winter 
and upheaval following the collapse of FTX have not 
turned Goldman away. Instead, Goldman’s head of 
digital assets, Mathew McDermott, described this as an 
opportunity to acquire crypto firms for cheap and to 
take a larger role in the industry.137 
Since 2021, Goldman has been busy growing its 
crypto business which means more exposure to 
Bitcoin. The bank re-opened a crypto trading desk 
that serves clients like hedge funds, endowments, 
and other institutional money managers.138 Goldman 
also started trading in derivatives tied to Bitcoin and 
was among the first Wall Street investment banks to 
buy and sell Bitcoin options and futures.139 In March 
2021, Goldman was the first major U.S. bank to trade 
crypto over-the-counter, rather than through a stock 
exchange, in a bitcoin-backed deal with crypto-bank 
Galaxy Digital.140 Then in April 2021, Goldman offered 
its first bitcoin-backed loan in which the borrower 
uses bitcoin as collateral. Bloomberg  heralded this as 
a major step in Wall Street’s Bitcoin offerings.141 In May 
2021, the company started trading a derivative tied 
to bitcoin that lets clients bet on the price of bitcoin 
without actually having to buy bitcoin. 
Reports suggest that Goldman is looking to increase 
crypto investment offerings which are sure to include 
Bitcoin since it is the largest and most valuable cryp -
tocurrency. Goldman’s global head of crypto trading, 
Andrei Kazantsev, said the bank is exploring new 
crypto markets and derivative products.142 For exam -
ple, Bloomberg  reports that Goldman is considering 
ways to offer hedge fund clients exchange-traded 
notes based on Bitcoin.143 The bank is also exploring 
other services and products including crypto custody 
services, which could provide safekeeping of custom -
ers’ Bitcoin.144 Goldman was reportedly exploring an 
ETF based on Bitcoin’s price in 2021, but thus far the 
SEC has rejected all applications for similar funds due 
to concerns about fraud and manipulation.145Goldman also has shareholdings in Bitcoin mining 
companies through funds the company manages 
and institutional holdings. Our research finds that 
Goldman controls shares in nine different mining 
companies with a total market value of around $28 
million.146 The firm also has director holdings of stock 
in CleanSpark and Riot Platforms – a company oper -
ating the most power-intensive mining operation in 
the U.S.147 Goldman holds another $1.23 million of 
bonds in Marathon Digital, the company that had kept 
a coal-fired power plant in Hardin, MT operating to 
supply electricity for mining Bitcoin.148
Goldman is the largest institutional holder, 3.13%, 
of the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments 
Fund, which tracks companies related to cryptocur -
rency, blockchain, and digital payments.149 
Another crypto growth area for Goldman is research, 
analysis, and data services. In November 2022, 
Goldman launched Datonomy, a new classification 
system for the cryptocurrency market in collaboration 
with global index provider MSCI and crypto data firm 
Coin Metrics.150
Climate
Goldman touts itself as a leader on climate and envi -
ronmental sustainability within the financial services 
industry. The bank has active climate and ESG initia -
tives with various pledges about reducing emissions 
and conducting environmentally responsible invest -
ments. Goldman has an A ESG rating from MSCI and 
an 81 from the S&P Global ESG ranking, similiar to 
peer companies.151 In March 2021, the bank joined the 
UN Net Zero Banking Alliance, the UN Net Zero Asset 
Owner Alliance, and the OS-Climate Initiative as its 
founding U.S. banking member.152 Goldman supports 
the United States returning to the Paris Climate 
Agreement and has pledged to align investments with 
a net zero by 2050 pathway. The company claims to 
have reached net zero in operations and seeks to 
reach net zero in company supply chains by 2030.153 
Goldman says the company will also address climate 
risks in its portfolio and investment strategies.154  
However, the company is not using targets validated 
by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a lead -
ing evaluator of company net zero plans.

1Goldman discloses emissions using the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards and 
in 2021 issued their inaugural Taskforce on Climate-
related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) report.155 Goldman 
also signed onto the UN Environment Program’s 
Principles for Responsible Banking.156 Goldman has 
pledged to conduct a carbon footprint analysis across 
their Fundamental Equity business within their Asset 
Management division which does not appear to include 
Bitcoin investments. While the company claims to apply 
rigorous environmental and social risk management, 
including a review of investments in carbon-intensive 
sectors, the company has not disclosed the climate 
impacts of Bitcoin-related investments.157
Goldman Executives have not publicly acknowledged 
Bitcoin’s climate impact or the company’s role 
in the problem. They have not responded to GPUS’s communications and have not expressed 
a willingness to participate in conversations and 
collaborations to solve Bitcoin’s climate problem. 
Yet, it appears that some people in the company 
are aware of the issue . Goldman has invested in 
Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP), a new company 
backed by major Bitcoin miners creating market-
based solutions to incentivize renewable energy use 
for Bitcoin mining.158 SBP plans to offer certificates 
for “green” Bitcoin mined with renewables which 
can then be bought and sold like a renewable 
energy credit.159 However, there is little evidence for 
the effectiveness of this approach, and it does not 
address the underlying problem with Bitcoin’s energy-
intensive code unlike switching away from PoW. 
Still, this investment signals that Goldman knows 
there is a problem and could be part of funding and 
supporting more transformative solutions.

1as “the first global bank to offer a blockchain-based 
platform for wholesale payments transactions, helping 
to re-architect the way that money, information and 
assets are moving around the world.”168 The bank 
completed a cross-border transaction using blockchain 
technologies which was called “a massive step for the 
crypto space.”169 Chase must live up to its commitment 
to “promote long-term, innovative solutions for a 
more sustainable future” by ensuring new blockchain 
technologies are built on a clean and sustainable 
system that does not use an energy-intensive 
consensus mechanism like PoW mining.170 
Climate
Chase is actively addressing climate change and says 
it is committed to increasing sustainability across the 
company’s operations and investments. Chase has an 
A rating on ESG from MSCI and the S&P Global ESG 
ranking puts the company at 73, lower than many 
peer companies. The bank has been a member of the 
UN’s Net Zero Banking Alliance since 2021 and has 
pledged to reach net zero by 2050.171 The bank claims 
it will align key sectors of its financing portfolio with 
the goals of the Paris Agreement and will set portfolio 
emissions reduction targets, including for carbon-
intensive sectors. Chase says it will report Scope 3 
emissions from the company’s value chain. However, 
the company’s net zero targets are not validated by 
the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).172
Chase has not indicated that Bitcoin-related invest -
ments are part of the company’s emissions reduc -
tion targets and reporting plans. The company has 
not made public statements or actions addressing 
Bitcion’s climate problem, nor has it responded to 
GPUS’s requests to meet.JPMorgan Chase & Co.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Chase) is one of the largest 
banks in the world with $3.7 trillion in assets and 
$121.6 million in revenue in 2021 and is a leader in 
retail, commercial, and investment banking.160 While 
Chase executives have been publicly critical of crypto, 
the company has started to expand into Bitcoin and 
other major cryptocurrencies. The company offers 
several bitcoin investment products and holds shares 
in Bitcoin mining companies.
CEO Jamie Dimon has been an outspoken critic of 
crypto. At the World Economic Forum in January 
2023, Dimon famously mocked cryptocurrency as a 
“waste of time” and Bitcoin as a “decentralized Ponzi 
scheme” and a “hyped-up fraud.”161 
Despite Dimon’s brash public statements, Chase 
started offering products and services tied to Bitcoin. 
In 2021, the bank launched an actively managed 
Bitcoin fund for private banking clients which is a 
partnership with NYDIG, the Bitcoin arm of asset man -
agement firm Stone Ridge. Chase advertises the fund 
as a cheap and safe way to invest in bitcoin.162 In July 
2021, the company expanded access to bitcoin invest -
ments for more clients by allowing financial advisors 
to give wealth management clients access to Bitcoin 
funds through Chase brokerage accounts.163 An internal 
memo told advisors that they could take orders to buy 
and sell five cryptocurrency products, including funds 
offered by Grayscale Investments that are tied to the 
price of bitcoin.164 At the time, this put Chase ahead of 
competitors like Goldman, Morgan Stanley, and Bank 
of America, which had not given retail wealth clients 
direct access to crypto products. Chase analysts also 
issue research and reports on the Bitcoin market, 
which clients and industry watchers use.165
Research also reveals Chase investments in Bitcoin 
mining companies. Through institutional holdings and 
managed funds, Chase controls shares in 17 mining 
companies with a total market value of over $26 mil -
lion.166 It has also invested in other crypto companies, 
including its February 2022 acquisition of a minority 
stake in TRM Labs, which provides crypto compliance 
and risk management services.167
Chase also uses blockchain technologies and is involved 
in decentralized finance (DeFi). The company created 
its own blockchain platform, Onyx, which it describes

1Section 3: Payment Processors
Payment processing companies provide the credit 
and debit cards fundamental to the modern economy 
and can play a pivotal role in turning Bitcoin from a 
speculative investment asset into an actual medium 
of exchange. Currently, it’s difficult to use Bitcoin for 
everyday purchases and transactions. However, Visa, 
Mastercard, and American Express are beginning to 
transform Bitcoin, making it easier to pay for everyday 
goods and services with bitcoin. 
Research also revealed that payment processors are 
creating new services that let customers buy and sell 
bitcoin. Further, this investigation uncovered technical 
assistance to banks and other companies to support 
adoption of cryptocurrencies. 
We examined the three largest payment processors 
based on revenue, which are among the biggest global 
brand names in credit and debit cards. Smaller digital 
payment companies like Block (formerly Square) and 
PayPal are very active in adopting Bitcoin into their services, and are vocal boosters of crypto. However, 
we did not include them in this report given our focus 
on traditional finance companies.
Our research shows that Visa and Mastercard are 
the most active in crypto and are creating a range of 
services that have ties to Bitcoin. Both companies 
have partnered with crypto exchanges to offer debit 
cards that facilitate payments using cryptocurrencies, 
including Bitcoin, though Visa appears to be expand -
ing these offerings more rapidly. Both offer consulting 
and data services related to crypto but Mastercard 
also has a start-up incubator dedicated to crypto. 
American Express is less active, but has invested in 
several crypto start-ups and is starting to create part -
nerships with crypto exchange companies that deal 
with Bitcoin. On the other hand, all three companies 
strive to be leaders on climate and sustainability, and 
have the strongest net zero pledges among the com -
panies we examined. Thus, Bitcoin presents a contra -
diction for these companies as well as an opportunity 
to lead innovation on cleaning up Bitcoin.

1American Express
American Express (Amex) is a global payments and 
travel services company that provides credit and 
debit cards for consumers and companies world -
wide. As of 2021, the company had 71.4 million cards 
issued and $24.4 billion in revenue.173 Amex has been 
slower and more hesitant to move into crypto than 
Visa and Mastercard. Yet, Amex has recently launched 
new crypto programs and invested in several crypto 
startup companies, creating some exposure to 
Bitcoin. 
Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri has taken a cau -
tious stance towards crypto, stating that crypto is a 
low priority for the company, and that cryptocurren -
cies are more like an asset such as gold or silver than 
a usable currency.174 Still, Amex is getting involved in 
crypto and using blockchain technologies. In 2017, 
Amex announced a service for U.S. corporate custom -
ers to send instant blockchain-based payments using 
Ripple to U.K. businesses that bank with Santander.175 
In 2022, Amex issued its first crypto rewards card 
through a partnership with crypto wealth manager 
Abra. The card provides rewards in Bitcoin along with 
other cryptocurrencies but makes transactions in 
U.S. Dollars, unlike some cards offered by Visa and 
Mastercard that facilitate payments in Bitcoin.176
Amex has a strategic investments and venture cap -
ital wing called American Express Ventures that has 
backed several crypto-related companies which has 
pushed Amex into the crypto sector. In 2015, Amex 
Ventures made one of its first investments in a crypto 
startup during a Series A funding round for Abra, a 
company that operates a crypto wallet and exchange 
where individuals and institutions can buy and sell 
bitcoin.177 The Amex fund was also an early investor 
in Stripe which created the technology underlying 
many payment systems. Stripe provides services to 
many crypto wallet and exchange companies, allowing 
them to move bitcoin to and from U.S. Dollars, and 
process payments.178 In 2021, Amex Ventures invested 
in a blockchain intelligence startup, TRM Labs.179 The 
company also invested in FalconX, a platform that 
supports institutions trading crypto, which Bloomberg  
described as a sign that large financial companies 
were moving into crypto.180 Amex Ventures global head 
Harshul Sanghi said, “Amex Ventures invests in start -
ups as a way to better understand emerging areas of the payments ecosystem, and we are pleased to 
support FalconX as it continues to drive innovation in 
the digital asset space, including digital currencies.”181 
Climate
Amex is a leader among peer companies on climate 
action and has active sustainability initiatives. The 
company has an AA MSCI ESG rating and is ranked 
85 by the S&P Global ESG ranking, lower than the 
other payment processing companies in this report.182 
The company has made an ambitious pledge to 
reach net zero emissions by 2035, in alignment 
with the SBTi.183 Amex claims to be carbon neutral 
in corporate operations since 2018 and powered 
by 100% renewable electricity. Amex participates 
in numerous global initiatives to address climate 
change, including the World Economic Forum’s 
Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition and the Global 
Future Council on Sustainable Tourism. Amex also 
says it incorporates ESG considerations into its 
risk management approach, including climate risks. 
The company supports the Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and is evaluating 
physical and transition risks in line with the TCFD 
recommendations.184 
Yet, Amex has not addressed how Bitcoin-related 
services align with company emissions disclosures, 
climate risk assessments, and net zero pledges. Amex 
staff did not reply to GPUS’s requests to meet and

1Mastercard
Mastercard is one of the largest payment and finan -
cial transaction processing companies in the world, 
with $22.2 billion in revenue and a net income of 
$9.93 billion in 2022.185 Billions of people and retailers 
rely on Mastercard’s debit and credit cards to make 
daily transactions. Mastercard is working to make it 
easier and safer for banks to adopt cryptocurrencies 
like Bitcoin and for merchants to support Bitcoin and 
other crypto payments. Mastercard could significantly 
impact the sector and dramatically scale up Bitcoin 
by enabling people to use it for regular transactions. 
Mastercard executives have extolled crypto includ -
ing Chief Executive Michael Miebach who wrote in a 
LinkedIn post about his vision for “bringing crypto to 
everyday purchases.”186
In 2021, Mastercard began partnerships that enable 
customers to use cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin,  
at more retailers.187 To do this, Mastercard announced 
a partnership with Bakkt, a firm that provides crypto 
custodial services, to allow millions of merchants on 
Mastercard’s payment network and banks to integrate 
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.188 Institutions, including 
big banks, that issue Mastercard credit and debit 
cards will be able to offer cards that convert bitcoin 
to fiat, facilitating payments with Bitcoin, and give 
customers reward points in Bitcoin.189 Although the 
program’s rollout is ongoing, this move could enable 
a major expansion in how people buy and spend 
Bitcoin. In 2022, Mastercard announced a partnership 
with one of the biggest crypto exchanges, Binance, 
to launch a card that lets users spend Bitcoin from 
their Binance accounts by converting crypto into U.S. 
Dollars, or other traditional currency, at the point of 
sale.190 The card was launched in Argentina with plans 
to expand and could eventually support the 90 mil -
lion online and physical stores across Mastercard’s 
network.191 In January 2023, Mastercard announced 
the launch of the Binance Card in Brazil which will be 
issued by Dock, a payment institution regulated by 
Brazil’s central bank.192 Mastercard is now expanding 
its crypto offerings in Europe with a partnership with 
Unbanked, which offers crypto supporting cards and 
other services for Web3 companies.193
Mastercard launched a program called Crypto Source  
in October 2022 that enables financial institutions 
to offer crypto trading to their clients.194 Mastercard 
will serve as a bridge between Paxos, a crypto trading platform, and banks, handling security issues that are 
barriers to financial institutions participating in crypto 
trading. The service could help banks compete with 
existing crypto exchanges like Coinbase by creating the 
ability for customers to buy and sell Bitcoin through 
their existing banks. This would build trust that could 
help mainstream Bitcoin investing. In another move 
to help banks manage risks and security threats from 
crypto, Mastercard launched a service called Crypto 
Secure to help find and prevent fraud on crypto mer -
chant platforms.195 
Mastercard has also invested in startup companies 
developing crypto-related services and products. In 
2015 Mastercard invested in Digital Currency Group 
(DCG) a company that invests in crypto startups 
and operates wholly-owned subsidiaries Genesis 
Global Trading, a Bitcoin trading firm, and Grayscale 
Investments, the firm managing the publicly traded 
Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) that lets people bet on the price 
of Bitcoin.196 DCG and its subsidiaries have become a 
major player in the Bitcoin and broader crypto indus -
try. Mastercard also has a fintech accelerator called 
the Start Path program that supports web3 startups 
and in 2021 launched a crypto-focused branch called 
Start Path Crypto. As of November 2022, the pro -
gram had invested in 25 crypto companies.197 Thus, 
Mastercard could direct its investments towards 
companies that use clean blockchain technology and 
provide financial support to groups working on innova -
tive solutions to change Bitcoin’s code.
Mastercard is also increasing staff to support expan -
sion into the crypto sector. Reports from early 2022 
indicate the company’s plans to hire 500 people were 
aimed in part at growing a data and services unit that 
includes consulting on crypto and helping banks with 
issues around crypto and ESG.198 However, this con -
sulting does not appear to address the ESG concerns 
related to Bitcoin.
Climate
Mastercard is trying to be a leader on corporate sus -
tainability and climate action. The company has a AA 
score from MSCI’s ESG rating, higher than the other 
companies in this report, and the S&P Global ESG 
ranking places them in the 91st percentile. Mastercard 
is active in numerous business coalitions supporting 
carbon reductions including the 1.5°C Supply Chain

1Leaders Initiative and the United Nations’ Race to 
Zero which supports small and medium suppliers 
to half emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 
2050.199 Mastercard is also a member of RE100, a 
coalition of businesses dedicated to sourcing 100% 
renewable electricity.200 In 2021, the company said 
executive compensation was tied to ESG goals, 
including carbon neutrality.201
Mastercard has strong climate commitments. The 
company has pledged to meet net zero goals by 2040, 
up from 2050. Mastercard also says its operations have 
been powered by 100% renewable energy since 2018, 
although much of that depends on renewable energy 
credits.202 The Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) 
has approved the company’s 1.5°C target, something 
Mastercard claims is a first among payment processing 
companies.203 Mastercard also reports GHG emissions 
and sets reduction targets aligned with the United 
Nations Business Ambition for a 1.5°C future using 
standards set by SBTi. Mastercard’s reduction strategy 
is focused on decarbonization across its value chain, 
including Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.204 
As part of emissions disclosures, Mastercard reports 
the energy used at data centers they own and mon -
itors energy use at data centers they rent but do not 
manage.205 However, Mastercard’s leaders have not addressed how Bitcoin-related investments and ser -
vices align with emissions reduction goals.
Mastercard is also working to increase carbon trans -
parency and accounting. The company has a carbon 
calculator that allows customers to estimate the car -
bon footprint of card purchases.206 In partnership with 
Doconomy, Mastercard offers a free mobile banking 
program that lets users track and reduce their CO2 
footprint.207 Yet, this transparency and emissions 
reporting is missing when it comes to Bitcoin pur -
chases and investments enabled by Mastercard.
Mastercard has engaged with GPUS about Bitcoin’s 
pollution and participated in discussions about the 
issue. Mastercard’s 2022 Sustainability Report states 
that the company has a preference for working with 
“energy efficient solutions that consider climate and 
community impacts” and supports research by the 
Cambridge Digital Assets Programme that examines 
the energy use and carbon emissions of cryptocurren -
cies, including Bitcoin.208 This is an important step in 
recognizing the need for sustainable digital assets and 
directing resources to technologies based on clean 
blockchains. Yet, Mastercard’s services still can include 
Bitcoin and the company has not issued a public state -
ment calling out Bitcoin’s climate pollution or taken 
action supporting solutions for cleaning up Bitcoin.

Visa is the world’s largest payment processor and pro -
vides credit and debit cards that are used by billions of 
people and accepted by millions of merchants.209 The 
company is expanding into crypto and exploring new 
ways for customers and businesses to use digital assets 
like Bitcoin. Visa could play a critical role in mainstream -
ing and growing Bitcoin by enabling people to spend and 
trade bitcoin more easily. In February 2023, a Reuters 
report claimed Visa was pausing new crypto partnerships 
and services.210 Visa leaders denied it and reaffirmed that 
the company was still moving forward in the sector.211
Visa has multiple crypto-linked credit and debit cards 
that enable customers to spend and earn rewards 
in bitcoin.212 Visa offers a card in partnership with 
Coinbase, a large crypto exchange company, that lets 
customers spend bitcoin in their Coinbase wallet at 
any retailer in Visa’s network and earn bitcoin rewards 
points.213 Visa has also partnered with Crypto.com to 
issue a prepaid card that lets customers add Bitcoin 
and U.S. Dollars while also earning rewards in Cronos 
(CRO), Crypto.com’s  cryptocurrency that is cleaner than 
Bitcoin since its based on a different consensus mech -
anism that does not use energy-intensive mining.214 Visa 
also offers the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards credit card 
that is a collaboration with startup company Upgrade 
and issued by Sutton Bank that gives customers 
rewards in bitcoin. When customers make payments 
with the card, bitcoin will be purchased for them and 
held in a wallet with NYDIG, a financial services com -
pany dedicated to Bitcoin.215 Visa had offered a debit 
card with FTX, but it was canceled in November 2022 
as the company imploded due to widespread fraud.216 
Partnerships with crypto companies have created a 
growing Bitcoin business for Visa. In the first quarter of 
2022, Visa reported that customers made $2.5 billion 
worth of purchases on their Visa crypto cards.217 The 
company said its network of crypto wallet partners 
grew to 65 in early 2022, including Coinbase, Circle, and 
BlockFi, and that almost 100 million merchants now 
accept crypto, including Bitcoin, on the Visa network.218 
Visa is also expanding its crypto offerings in the United 
Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. The company 
created a long-term strategic partnership with Wirex, a 
crypto platform, to expand in those regions and offer 
crypto debit and prepaid cards that support Bitcoin.219 
Visa also partnered with Binance to offer a crypto debit card to customers in select European countries 
that would facilitate bitcoin payments.220
Visa also operates a Digital Currency Innovation Hub 
that helps clients understand crypto and other emerg -
ing technologies to create new opportunities. The 
group publishes educational materials on crypto and 
claims to work with software engineers on new con -
cepts.221 Visa also offers crypto consulting and advisory 
services to help clients, including financial institutions 
and retailers, understand and navigate cryptocurren -
cies.222  In 2021, Visa invested in a blockchain intelli -
gence startup, TRM Labs.223 Bitcoin, as the largest and 
most valuable cryptocurrency, is likely a part of these 
services. Yet, Visa does not appear to be using these 
resources and expertise to address Bitcoin’s pollution 
and climate impacts.
Climate
Visa is active in efforts to address climate change and 
has a range of corporate sustainability initiatives. The 
company has an A score from MSCI’s ESG rating and 
placed at 93 on the S&P Global ESG rank. Visa joined 
The Climate Pledge, a group of companies pledging to 
reach net zero by 2040, the Climate Business Network, 
a World Wildlife Fund initiative to accelerate efforts 
to net zero, and the UN Race to Zero.224 Thus, Visa 
has pledged to reach net zero by 2040 in line with 
the goals set by the Paris Climate Agreement. To do 
so, Visa has set science based emissions reductions 
targets that would meet 1.5C pathways which have 
been validated by SBTi.225 Visa claims to have achieved 
carbon neutrality in its operations and to use 100% 
renewable energy.226 Visa also claims to embed sus -
tainability into its partnerships and initiatives, but the 
company does not appear to be applying those princi -
ples in Bitcoin-related partnerships. 
Visa also offers a CO2 calculator for customers to track 
the emissions from their purchases. Yet, Visa does not 
offer specific calculations for Bitcoin purchases on 
their crypto cards, which have a much larger carbon 
footprint than U.S. Dollar and other traditional currency 
purchases.227 
Despite Visa’s strong climate pledges, the company has 
not addressed Bitcoin’s large carbon footprint and, as 
of publication, has not taken concrete actions to solve 
the problem despite the company’s growing role in the 
Bitcoin space. Leaders from the company have taken an 
initial step in responding to GPUS to discuss the issue.

1INNOV ATING BITCOIN 
FOR A W ARMING WORLD
Financial services companies need to reckon with 
Bitcoin’s climate impact and step up to address the 
problem. All of the nine companies we evaluated have 
exposure to Bitcoin but no concrete plans to reconcile 
that with corporate climate pledges and sustainability 
programs. Many stakeholders are passing the buck and 
trying to avoid responsibility for Bitcoin’s climate and 
community impacts. Yet, big financial services compa -
nies both play a vital role in the industry and have the 
expertise and resources to drive innovative solutions. 
Financial institutions cannot claim to be cutting-edge 
while maintaining their support for Bitcoin in its cur -
rent form, which relies on growing amounts of electric -
ity powered largely by outdated fossil fuels. 
At the time of this report, the crypto industry is 
largely unregulated and there is a lack of transpar -
ency about the location, energy use, and emissions 
of Bitcoin mining sites. An important first step is 
increased reporting of GHG emissions from Bitcoin 
mining and disclosure of financial institutions’ 
Bitcoin-related investments and emissions. Yet more fundamental and transformative solutions 
are possible. A shift away from PoW mining toward 
a new, less energy-intensive consensus mechanism 
could slash Bitcoin’s carbon and environmental foot -
print. Creating a new clean blockchain for Bitcoin can 
make it less risky and future-proof it for the impacts 
of climate change and energy transitions. And finan -
cial services companies should lead the way in chang -
ing Bitcoin’s code.
Cleaning up Bitcoin will be a substantial social and 
technical undertaking. We will need leaders from the 
financial services sector and Bitcoin industry to take 
responsibility for drastically reducing their carbon 
footprint by coordinating to develop and implement 
a new consensus mechanism and building support 
among Bitcoin stakeholders to support a code change.
Failure to innovate Bitcoin is simply not an option. To 
avert the worst consequences of climate change, we 
need to transform the ways we produce and consume 
energy. That includes finding a sustainable solution to 
Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining process.

1The best way to create a sustainable solution is for 
all stakeholders to work collaboratively. With Bitcoin 
miners, developers, and crypto companies at the 
table with financial institutions and climate experts, 
we can generate creative and innovative solutions 
that ensure the needs of the Bitcoin community and 
the planet are met. 
Greenpeace USA is calling on large financial compa -
nies to initiate the conversations and collaborations 
necessary to develop and implement Bitcoin’s evolu -
tion toward a carbon-free system. Companies could 
fund startups and developers creating new clean 
consensus mechanisms and blockchain technologies, 
and support working groups and alliances with indus -
try organizations and nonprofits developing solutions. 
Specifically, we are demanding the financial institu -
tions covered in this report do the following:
 ◼Publicly acknowledge Bitcoin’s pollution and its 
negative impacts to the climate and communities
 ◼Publicly support a code change that switches 
Bitcoin to a cleaner protocol that does not rely on 
energy and carbon-intensive digital mining ◼Participate in convening experts, industry, and 
policymakers to create a new consensus mech -
anism that uses dramatically less energy and 
ushers in a clean-future for Bitcoin
 ◼Fund startups, nonprofits, academics, and other 
developers that are working on sustainable 
blockchain technologies and ways to change 
Bitcoin’s code 
 ◼Until a new consensus mechanism is developed 
and meaningful progress is made toward its 
implementation, pause further Bitcoin expansion, 
including:
 ⚫New partnerships and investments with 
exchanges and mining companies
 ⚫New services that facilitate bitcoin 
transactions and investing
 ⚫New products that support Bitcoin
Bitcoin revolutionized cryptocurrencies when it 
launched in 2009. It now has the opportunity to show 
the strength of its community by creating a new 
secure, decentralized consensus mechanism that is 
aligned with a livable planet.

1Company Selection 
Financial companies were selected from three differ -
ent categories: banks, asset managers, and payment 
processors. Each of these sectors are essential to 
maintaining the Bitcoin system and enabling Bitcoin’s 
wider adoption. Banks and asset managers provide 
investments and financial services that Bitcoin min -
ing, software, hardware, and services companies 
need. Banks and asset managers also support trading 
in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related products like futures 
contracts and derivatives. Payment processors enable 
transactions with Bitcoin and provide vital software 
and data services that let other financial institu -
tions use cryptocurrencies. Within each category, 
we reviewed the largest U.S.-based companies and selected those most active in Bitcoin based on com -
pany statements and media coverage. The three asset 
managers (BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard) are 
the largest by assets under management and all had 
ties to Bitcoin. The payment processing companies 
(American Express, Mastercard, and Visa) are the larg -
est based on number of cardholders and number of 
transactions. Companies focused on digital payments, 
like PayPal and Block, that are actively involved with 
Bitcoin were excluded since they are smaller compa -
nies with less impact on the global financial system. 
For the banking sector, we examined the ten largest 
U.S.-based commercial and investment banks and 
through our preliminary research identified JP Morgan, 
Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs as the most involved 
with Bitcoin.METHODOLOGY

1Bitcoin Investments  
and Exposure
Tracing investments in Bitcoin is challenging and dif -
ferent to examining investments in traditional indus -
tries such as oil and gas. Bitcoin is unique because it 
is an investment asset as well as a form of payment 
that relies on software, hardware, and financial ser -
vices companies. Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency more 
broadly, also lacks critical regulatory frameworks 
to provide transparency, predictability, and sound 
governance. 
The most direct way companies can have exposure to 
Bitcoin is through corporate holdings, but these can 
be hard to track because the Bitcoin blockchain is 
anonymous. Although publicly traded companies typ -
ically disclose cryptocurrency holdings in SEC filings. 
Another way financial companies can have exposure 
to the Bitcoin system is through connections to 
companies that do mining, create Bitcoin-related 
software, and provide services that support Bitcoin. 
Thus, there are many ways for financial companies 
to have ties to Bitcoin which are not clearly quantifi -
able or comparable. In addition, many Bitcoin related 
programs and services offered by financial services 
companies are new, and the size and impact of them 
remain unclear.
Share Holdings in Publicly Traded 
Bitcoin Mining Companies
Our research assessed investments in Bitcoin mining 
companies since they are directly involved in creating 
Bitcoin’s pollution. They depend on financial institu -
tions to raise capital and one way is to sell shares 
in the company to the public. To assess financial 
companies’ shareholdings, we first identified publicly 
traded Bitcoin mining companies. Since there is no 
standardized industry classification for Bitcoin mining, 
we created our own list of companies through news 
reports, industry group membership, and other public 
information sources. We identified 27 publicly traded 
companies that are involved in Bitcoin mining. Using 
Bloomberg Terminal, an industry-leading financial 
database, we collected data on the shareholdings 
of all 27 companies and identified shares controlled by the nine financial companies. We found that our 
target companies had holdings in 24 of the miners. 
Our shareholding calculations include direct institu -
tional holdings as well as subsidiaries, mutual and 
index funds, and ETFs. Thus, shares are not necessar -
ily owned by the financial company but the company 
does control the assets. The value of shareholdings 
was based on the number of shares and the current 
share price when the data was collected on April 
25, 2023. Since shares are bought and sold on stock 
exchanges, companies’ holdings and share prices 
change regularly. Thus, the data is a snapshot in time.
Bond Holdings in Bitcoin Mining Companies
Another way for Bitcoin miners to raise capital is 
through corporate bonds. Banks and asset man -
agers can invest in these companies by holding 
bonds – portions of corporate loans that are bought 
and sold by investors. Buying a bond means the 
investor becomes a creditor to the company and 
gets paid back over a set period along with interest. 
Bondholders are creditors to the company, unlike 
shareholders who are a partial owner of the issuing 
company. Most of the Bitcoin mining companies we 
identified are relatively small and new, thus few have 
issued corporate bonds. In the Bloomberg Terminal 
we used the SECF command to find bond corporate 
data and identified two Bitcoin miners’ bonds held by 
the companies in our study. We report this data in the 
company profiles.
Lending and Underwriting
Banks also provide important services and invest -
ments for companies by managing the issuance of 
shares and bonds. For example, if a Bitcoin mining 
company wants to go public, they need a bank to lead 
an initial public offering (IPO) to issue and then sell 
the shares. Banks provide similar underwriting ser -
vices for the issuance of bonds, essentially breaking a 
loan into smaller pieces that can be bought and sold. 
Banks can also provide direct loans to companies. We 
searched the Bloomberg Terminal for data on banks 
involved with lending and underwriting for Bitcoin 
mining companies. We did not find any deals involving 
our nine target companies via Bloomberg’s League 
tables - an industry-leading methodology to assign

searched for other loans with the Bloomberg LSRC 
function and searched individual mining companies’ 
corporate action history to identify banks involved 
with equity offerings like IPOs. 
Bitcoin Investment Products and Services
Financial services companies have just started 
launching cryptocurrency-related products, services, 
and partnerships in the past few years. Many are also 
outside of traditional financial markets and regulatory 
reporting requirements and offered for private wealth 
clients. Thus, there is limited data on the scope and 
size of these products. We relied on news coverage, 
press releases, company websites, and other public 
information sources to identify how financial compa -
nies are getting involved in Bitcoin. The value, size and 
scope of these products and services is often hard 
to determine and quantify. Creating tools for clients 
to buy and sell Bitcoin, or partnering with a crypto exchange company to offer Bitcoin debit cards are 
not quantifiable like shareholdings in a Bitcoin mining 
company. 
While we did identify some investment products that 
are focused on Bitcoin, like Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF, 
many others are not Bitcoin specific. Many of the ser -
vices, programs, and departments companies are cre -
ating support a range of cryptocurrencies. However, 
since Bitcoin is by far the largest and most valuable 
cryptocurrency, these services are most likely sup -
porting Bitcoin unless Bitcoin is explicitly excluded. 
Financial companies are also developing block -
chain-based products and technologies that do not 
involve Bitcoin. However, we include some of that 
information because we think financial services 
companies have a stake in ensuring that the broader 
digital asset and cryptocurrency space is not polluting 
and contributing to the climate crisis.

1Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs):  
Specialized computers used by Bitcoin miners to 
calculate guesses, called hashes, for solving algorithms 
in the Proof of Work process. To be profitable, miners 
need large amounts of the fastest and most efficient 
ASICs which creates pressure to regularly update 
equipment, producing e-waste.228 ASICs are also highly 
specialized and have limited use beyond Bitcoin mining 
so there is limited potential for repurposing them.
Blockchain:  A collectively managed and decentralized 
digital ledger that is used to track and record trans -
actions in an open yet secure way without a central 
authority like a bank or government. In the Bitcoin sys -
tem, thousands of computers, or nodes, run software 
to store copies of the entire Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin 
was an early innovator in blockchain technologies in 
2009, but the use of blockchains has grown rapidly in 
recent years and has applications well beyond cryp -
tocurrencies. For example, groups are exploring how 
blockchain technologies could be used for carbon 
accounting and tracking, and in international develop -
ment programs and micro-loans.229
Block Subsidy:  Amount of new coins (e.g., bitcoins) 
produced and added to a block, awarded to the miner 
that successfully records that block. 
Consensus mechanism:  The process used by block -
chain technologies to verify transactions and secure 
the digital ledger. Participants in a blockchain network, 
like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, need a mecha -
nism for reaching agreement that a set of transactions 
are valid and preventing double-counting – spending 
the same Bitcoin twice. This mechanism is the back -
bone of a cryptocurrency’s blockchain and how cryp -
tocurrencies can operate without a central authority 
like a government. There are many different types of 
consensus mechanisms including Proof of Space, Proof 
of Authority, and Proof of Burn. Currently, the most 
widely used cryptocurrency consensus mechanisms 
are Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.230 However, this 
is a dynamic field with new mechanisms and protocols 
being developed and tested.GLOSSARYCustodianship:  Cryptocurrencies, like other valuable 
assets including stocks, gold, and money, need to be 
stored safely and securely which is often done through 
a third party, a custodian. For crypto, custodians safely 
store customers’ private keys – the passwords – to 
their crypto holdings, not the crypto coins themselves 
that exist on the public ledger called the blockchain. 
Institutions that manage people’s money and other 
assets, like asset managers and investment banks, are 
required to have a custodian store a client’s assets 
and keep it separated from the company’s finances. 
This protects clients’ assets in case of a bankruptcy. 
Yet in the largely unregulated crypto industry, many 
companies that offer crypto exchange and wallet 
services have not securely stored client holdings with a 
custodian. This contributes to risky business practices 
where company and client crypto assets are mixed, 
and customers potentially losing their investments 
when companies have gone bankrupt such as FTX.231 
Cryptocurrency:  A digital form of currency that relies 
on a decentralized blockchain and cryptography to 
ensure transparency and security. Currently cryptocur -
rencies are primarily used as investments and a way 
to store value, although value that is quite volatile, 
and less frequently used as a medium of exchange. 
However, payment processing companies are start -
ing to integrate cryptocurrencies, making it easier for 
casual users to spend crypto and make transactions. 
Cryptocurrencies are one type of digital asset which 
include a range of different virtual products like non -
fungible tokens (NFTs) and tokenized assets - turning 
physical assets like stock or even land into a digital 
asset.
Crypto exchange:  An online trading platform used to 
buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and 
convert cryptocurrencies to and from government-is -
sued money like US Dollars. Popular exchanges include 
those run by Coinbase and Binance.
Crypto wallet:  Cryptocurrencies need to be stored 
somewhere and owners need to make sure the private 
keys, or password, to their cryptocurrency is kept 
safe and secure. Thus, wallets are used which can 
be physical devices similar to a hard drive, software 
programs, or online services like those operated by 
Coinbase and Binance.

1De-centralized Finance (DeFi):  A broad term for an 
emerging field of finance that works outside of tra -
ditional financial institutions and companies using 
public blockchains to facilitate direct transactions 
between users without intermediaries. An important 
tool is smart contracts that are code on a blockchain 
which can automatically execute the terms of an 
agreement once a set of criteria are met, eliminating 
the need for parties to meet. Ethereum is used for 
many DeFi services. Bitcoin, however, is not a cen -
tral component to the broader DeFi industry in part 
because its code and PoW mechanism have fewer 
uses and do not support services like smart contracts.
Exchange traded fund (ETF):  An investment security 
that typically tracks a certain index, sector, or commod -
ity which is similar to a mutual fund but is traded on a 
stock exchange. There are ETFs that track the crypto 
industry and the price of Bitcoin, although the U.S. has 
not approved an ETF tied to Bitcoin’s spot price yet due 
to concerns about risk and lack of regulatory oversight.
Net zero:  The goal of companies, institutions, and 
countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) or carbon 
dioxide emissions to net zero, usually involving a mix of 
approaches designed to reduce or  eliminate emissions 
and offsetting all remaining emissions with removal 
of GHGs from the atmosphere. Many companies have 
pledges to reach net zero often by 2050 or earlier, and 
to create pathways to net zero that are aligned with 
the Paris Climate agreement and goals to keep global 
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs):  A physical or virtual item, 
like a painting or a song, that has been tokenized to 
become a digital asset by using a blockchain. Each NFT 
is assigned a unique identification code and metadata 
which reduces the likelihood of fraud while enabling 
buying, selling, and trading – often in cryptocurrencies. 
NFTs have been popular in the art world but can also 
include other physical objects, people’s identities, and 
property rights. NFTs are like a digital form of a collec -
tor’s item. Most NFTs have been created on Ethereum 
which provides a way to track their ownership. Bitcoin 
was originally not used for NFTs but in the past year an 
update to the Bitcoin code made it possible to create 
NFTs on the Bitcoin network. This is controversial and 
contested in the Bitcoin community. Yet, other platforms, 
like Ethereum, remain the most popular and useful for 
NFTs, which also means they have a very small carbon 
footprint since they do not rely on Proof of Work.Proof of Work (PoW):  A consensus mechanism used 
by some cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, to vali -
date and secure transactions that involves “miners” 
competing to solve algorithms – doing work – and 
the chance to verify and add a new set of transitions, 
a block, to the blockchain. In return, the winner gets 
newly created coins and fees. This system is used to 
provide security for the blockchain and prevent mali -
cious actors from disrupting the system
Proof of Stake (PoS):  A consensus mechanism used by 
many cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, to validate 
transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain. The 
process involves owners of a cryptocurrency placing 
coins as collateral, “staking,” in order to get the chance 
to validate a new set of transactions in return for fees 
and/or new coins. Validators are chosen at random, 
but the more coins a participant puts in, or stakes, 
the greater the chance they have at winning. If a par -
ticipant tampers with or adds faulty transactions, they 
lose the coins they staked. Thus, participants have an 
interest in maintaining the security and integrity of the 
system. PoS does not require large computing power 
as participants can validate transactions and update 
the blockchain on their personal computers.
Scope 1 emissions:  Direct GHG emissions from sources 
that are directly owned or controlled by the company 
such as the emissions from a coal fired power plant 
that a company owns. 
Scope 2 emissions:  GHG emissions caused indirectly by 
a company through the production of energy it pur -
chases and uses, such as the electricity purchased to 
run a factory or data center. 
Scope 3 emissions:  GHG emissions that the company 
is indirectly responsible for along its value chain, 
including the impact of goods purchased and sold, and 
all the emissions not included in Scope 1 or 2. For the 
financial sector this includes investments, and lending 
and advisory services. For example, a bank that pro -
vides a loan to a coal mining company.
Stablecoin:  A type of cryptocurrency that is supposed 
to be backed by fiat money, like the U.S. Dollar, or 
some physical asset.  The price of a stablecoin is 
supposed to be more stable and follow that of the fiat 
money it’s tied to, unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin 
for which the price is set by the market and typically 
highly volatile.

113 The main operating costs for Bitcoin mining companies 
are electricity and computing hardware, thus there 
is pressure to have the most efficient equipment 
and get rid of slower and less efficient ASICS which 
become unprofitable to operate. ASICS are also 
highly-specialized and few other functions beyond 
mining Bitcoin, thus they are often thrown away rather 
than reused for other purposes. For more explanation 
of this dynamic and an assessment of Bitcoin’s 
e-waste generation, see: Vries, Alex de, and Christian 
Stoll. December 1, 2021. “Bitcoin’s Growing e-Waste 
Problem.” Resources, Conservation and Recycling  175:
