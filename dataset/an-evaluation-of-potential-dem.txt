An Evaluation of Potential Demand for 
Renewable Generation 
 H.R. 2454 (Waxman-Markey) Renewable Electricity St andard vs.
Existing State Renewable Portfolio Standards 
Prepared for Greenpeace 
September 25, 2009 


Overview 
/head2rightTask 
– Conduct a comparative analysis of renewable genera tion requirements under the 
proposed H.R. 2454 (Waxman-Markey) Renewable Electr icity Standard (RES) 
and renewable generation requirements under existin g state Renewable Portfolio 
Standards (RPS) 
/head2rightAssumptions were derived from EIA and EPA analyses of the 
Waxman-Markey bill
– EIA: Energy Market and Economic Impacts of H.R. 2454, th e American Clean 
Energy and Security Act of 2009 
• Released July 2009; Modified August 5, 2009 • Forecasts through 2030 
– EPA: Analysis of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 H.R. 2454 
in the 111th Congress 
• Released June 23, 2009 • Forecasts through 2025 

Renewable Generation Demand under Federal RES vs. State RPS - Evaluation Methodology 
/head2rightFederal RES Analysis 
– Relied upon EPA and EIA projections: 
• Average annual retail demand growth • New nuclear and coal + carbon capture and storage (CCS) generation 
– Assumed that Federal RES applies to 78% of LSEs (t hose with 4 million MWh + 
of annual generation) 
/head2rightState RPS demand analysis 
– Relied upon EIA 2007 base energy sales data by loa d-serving entity (LSE) 
• Source: EIA, “Table 10. Class of Ownership, Number  of Bundled Ultimate Consumers, 
Revenue, Sales, and Average Retail Price for All Se ctors by State, Utility, 2007.”
– Evaluated how RPS regulations impact LSEs 
• Sources of RPS demand regulations: various, includ ing state legislature and regulatory 
agency websites, Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS ), LBNL, and DSIRE database. 
• Where RPS requirements are mandated as shares of f inal sales, the RPS is determined 
by projecting total energy sales from affected load -serving entities (LSE), multiplied by 
LSE-level RPS percentage requirement as per relevan t state legislation. 

HR 2454: American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (Waxman-Markey Bill) 
/head2rightApproved by the House on June 26, 2009. 
/head2rightCombined Efficiency and Renewable Electricity Stand ard - CERES (Title I, 
Subtitle A, Sec. 101) 
– Requires retail electricity providers to meet a mi nimum share of sales with electricity savings 
and qualifying renewable generation by holding trad able credits. 
– Nominal targets begin at 6% in 2012 and rise to 20 % by 2020. 
– Qualifying renewable resources include new and exi sting solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, 
qualified waste-to-energy 1, geothermal, and qualified hydroelectric. 2
– Retailers selling less than 4 million MWh per year  are exempted from CERES. 
– Up to 25 percent of the target may be met with ele ctricity savings (Governors may petition to 
raise this amount to 40 percent). 
– Sales of generation from new nuclear, new coal wit h carbon-capture and sequestration 
(CCS), and existing hydropower capacity are deducte d from each retail provider’s total sales 
for assessing the CERES requirement 
1 Qualified waste-to-energy means energy from the co mbustion of municipal solid waste or construction, demolition, or disaster debris, or from the 
gassification or pyrolization of such waste or debr is and the combustion of the resulting gas at the s ame facility. For further information see HR 2454 
subsection(a)(13). 
2 Qualified hydropower means energy produced from in creased efficiency achieved, or additions of capaci ty made on or after Jan.1,1988 at a 
hydroelectric  facility or dam placed in service be fore that date.  For further information see HR 245 4 subsection (a)(12). 

State Renewable Portfolio Standards 
/head2right29 states plus the District of Columbia have passed  mandatory renewable 
generation requirements or goals and 5 more have pa ssed voluntary 
standards or goals. 
/head2rightThe design of each RPS varies by target and timing,  the types of renewable 
generation allowed, the geographic scope within whi ch a generator might be 
eligible to meet the standard, and the types enforc ement mechanisms and 
escape clauses included.

Demand for Renewable Generation under Existing State RPS 
8/head2rightAssuming EIA and EPA demand growth estimates, deman d for renewable generation under state 
renewable portfolio standards around the U.S. range s from approximately 16,000 TWh (roughly 5% 
of base retail demand) to over 40,000 TWh (roughly 10% of base retail demand) between 2012 
and 2030. 
/head2rightEPA and EIA annual average demand growth projection s are slightly different (0.57% v. 0.64% 
respectively )


State RPS v. Waxman-Markey Federal RES 
/head2rightWhen using EIA and EPA assumptions, the demand ulti mately created for 
renewable generation through the proposed Waxman-Ma rkey Federal RES 
is somewhat weaker than that created by existing st ate RPS programs. 
/head2rightThe following exhibit provides an overview of the p rovisions included in 
CERES that diminish the projected demand for renewa bles. 
/head2rightThe following comparative analysis provides a more in depth review of how 
these factors reduce the ultimate demand for renewa bles under the CERES 
provision of H.R. 2454 and how that effective deman d relates to that 
projected to develop under existing state RPS progr ams.

Conclusions 

State RPS vs. Waxman-Markey Federal RES Conclusions 
/head2rightThe effective demand for renewable generation under  a federal
standard falls short of that projected to develop u nder existing state 
programs in the EIA case.  In the EPA case there is  a shortfall in 
early years but in outer years this shortfall is el iminated.  The extent 
of the shortfalls in the EPA case are less signific ant than that found 
in the EIA case. 
/head2rightGiven that EPA and EIA demand growth projections ar e very similar, 
the difference in the extent and timing of the proj ected shortfalls can 
be explained by the notable differences between EPA  and EIA 
projections of new nuclear and coal + CCS generatio n.  These 
differences and their impacts are shown in the next  two exhibits.
