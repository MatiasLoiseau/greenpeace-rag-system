The announcement of Apple’s iPad has been much
anticipated by a world with an ever-increasing appetite for
mobile computing devices as a way to connect, interact,
learn and work. As rumours circulated – first about its
existence and then about its capabilities - the iPad
received more media attention than any other gadget in
recent memory. Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs
finally showcased his company’s latest creation before a
rapt audience in San Francisco. From their smart phones
and netbooks, the crowd feverishly blogged and tweeted
real time updates out to a curious world.

Whether you actually want an iPad or not, there is no
doubt that it is a harbinger of things to come. The iPad
relies upon cloud-based computing to stream video,
download music and books, and fetch email. Already,
millions access the ‘cloud’ to make use of online social
networks, watch streaming video, check email and create
documents, and store thousands of digital photos online
on popular web-hosted sites like Flickr and Picasa.

The term cloud, or cloud computing, used as a metaphor
for the internet, is based on an infrastructure and business
model whereby - rather than being stored on your own
device - data, entertainment, news and other products
and services are delivered to your device, in real time,
from the internet. The creation of the cloud has been a
boon both to the companies hosting it and to consumers
who now need nothing but a personal computer and
internet access to fulfill most of their computing needs.

Google is perhaps the most famous cloud-based company to
demonstrate the potential of a cloud platform to drive a hugely
successful business model. All of Google’s signature products - Gmail,
Google Documents and Google Earth - are delivered from the cloud.
Its ambitious project to create a digital library will be entirely hosted by
servers storing most of the world’s published work, all in digitised form.

The cloud is growing at a time when climate change and reducing
emissions from energy use is of paramount concern. With the growth
of the cloud, however, comes an increasing demand for energy.
For all of this content to be delivered to us in real time, virtual mountains
of video, pictures and other data must be stored somewhere and be
available for almost instantaneous access. That ‘somewhere’ is data
centres - massive storage facilities that consume incredible amounts
of energy.

But decisions about how the cloud will be built out are being made by
business leaders primarily concerned with quarterly profit statements
and earnings for shareholders.

Facebook vs. Yahoo

For example, in January 2010, Facebook commissioned a new data
centre in Oregon and committed to a power service provider
agreement with PacificCorp, a utility that gets the majority of its energy
from coal-fired power stations, the United States’ largest source of
greenhouse gas emissions. Effectively becoming an industrial-scale
consumer of electricity, Facebook now faces the same choices and
challenges that other large ‘cloud-computing’ companies have in
building their data centres. With a premium being placed on access to
the cheapest electricity available on the grid. In many countries, this
means dirty coal.

All the same, other companies have made better decisions for siting
some of their data centres. Yahoo!, for instance, chose to build a data
centre outside Buffalo, New York, that is powered by energy from a
hydroelectric power plant - dramatically decreasing its carbon
footprint. Google Energy, a subsidiary of cloud leader Google, applied
and was recently approved as a regulated wholesale buyer and seller
of electricity in the United States, giving it greater flexibility as to where it
buys its electricity to power its data centres.

Brown cloud or green cloud?

Ultimately, if cloud providers want to provide a truly green and
renewable cloud, they must use their power and influence to not only
drive investments near renewable energy sources, but also become
involved in setting the policies that will drive rapid deployment of
renewable electricity generation economy-wide, and place greater
R&D into storage devices that will deliver electricity from renewable
sources 24/7. (See page 11 for prescriptive policy recommendations
for IT companies.)

If we hope to phase out dirty sources of energy to address climate
change, then - given the massive amounts of electricity needed in
order to run computers, provide backup power and coordinate related
cooling equipment that even energy-efficient data centres consume -
the last thing we need is for more cloud infrastructure to be built in
places where it increases demand for dirty coal-fired power. The
potential of ICT technologies and cloud computing to drive low-carbon
economic growth underscore the importance of building cloud
infrastructure in places powered by clean renewable energy.
Companies like Facebook, Google, and other large players in the
cloud computing market must advocate for policy change at the local,
national and international levels to ensure that, as their appetite for
energy increases, so does the supply of renewable energy.

believed that IT is
the engine of an
efficient economy;
it also can drive a
greener one”

How big is the carbon footprint of the
Information Technology and Communication sector?

In 2008, The Climate Group and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative
(GeSI) issued SMART 2020: enabling the low carbon economy in the
information age.i The study highlighted the significant and rapidly-
growing footprint of the ICT industry and predicted that because of the
rapid economic expansion in places like India and China, among other
causes, demand for ICT services will quadruple by 2020.

SMART 2020 also found that:

• PC ownership will quadruple between 2007 and 2020 to 4 billion
devices, and emissions will double over the same period, with
laptops overtaking desktops as the main source of global ICT
emissions (22%).

• Mobile phone ownership will almost double to nearly 5 billion

accounts by 2020, but emissions will only grow by 4%. Broadband
uptake will treble to almost 900 million accounts over the same
period, with emissions doubling over the entire telecoms
infrastructure.

The Smart 2020 study also made a compelling case for ICT’s
significant potential to deliver climate and energy solutions, estimating
that ICT technologies could cut 7.8 GtCO2 of global greenhouse gas
emissions by 2020, a 15% reduction over business-as-usual
projections. The study posits that innovations from the ICT sector -
when combined with increased use of renewable energy - can put the
world on a more sustainable path and help keep global temperature
increase below the 2°C threshold scientists say is needed to hold off
the worst effects of climate change.

Cloud Computing Growth

2010 has been touted by many in the ICT sector as the ‘Year of the
Cloud’. While this is likely a prediction that will be repeated in
subsequent years, the arrival of the iPad and growth in netbooks and
other tablet computers, the launch of Microsoft’s Azure cloud services
for business, and the launch of the Google phone and the proliferation
of mobile cloud applications are compelling signs of a movement
towards cloud-based computing within the business sector and public
consciousness in a way never seen before.

3 key trends in cloud-based computing

• Continued significant expansion of cloud-based computing despite

economic downturn

• Greater attention and growth in deployment of energy-efficient data

centres design

• Increased size and scale of data centres being built by major brands

Key questions for cloud-based computing data centre
investment

• How big is the cloud in electricity consumption and GHG emissions

and how big will it become?

• Where will the cloud be built and what sources of energy will be

powering it?

• How may large data centres impact the surrounding load centre’s

demand for fossil fuels?

• To what extent will efficiency and design improvements reduce the

rate of growth?

Powering the cloud -
how much will it take?

How much electricity or associated greenhouse gas pollution is
currently produced or will be generated to power a much bigger cloud
in 10 years? The answer is far from clear, given the rapid growth, and
that many major cloud brands refuse to disclose their energy footprint.

The Smart 2020 analysis forecast that the global carbon footprint of the
main components of cloud-based computing - data centres and the
telecommunications network - would see their emissions grow, on
average, 7% and 5% respectively each year between 2002-2020.
Underlying this analysis is the number of data centre servers growing
on average 9% each year during this period.

Using the global analysis and forecast of the overall ICT emissions
footprint in the Smart 2020 Report as a foundation, the following
reports seeks to shine a fresh light on the electricity demand of the
global cloud, highlighting the scale of the potential demand and

importance of where and what sources of electricity are being used to
power Facebook, Gmail, and other cloud-based computing platforms.
The first of the two adjustments were made to the analysis used in the
Smart 2020 Report to disaggregate the projections for growth in the
main components of cloud based computing, and place in context of
electricity demand and renewable energy supply. The third adjustment
incorporates some bottom up analysis of energy demand from data
centres in the US, and the scale impact on the size of the overall
electricity demand if more accurate estimation of the energy demand
and GHG emissions associated with large data centres.To make the
data of the report more accessible as an instrument to evaluate the
projected impact of the cloud on electricity demand and their
relationship to energy policies, the Smart 2020 analysis has been de-
aggregated to show overall electricity consumption as outlined below.

Adjustments to Smart
2020 Report

Smart 2020 Adjustment #1:
Scope of Telecoms network reporting

The Smart 2020 Report provides carbon footprint figures in MtCO2e as
a combination of two sources of emissions: indirect emissions from
electricity use (scope 2) and indirect emissions from upstream
production (scope 3), or embodied carbon. To show electricity or
energy use emissions separately, a correction factor [Scope 2/ (Scope
2+3)] will be applied as shown in the table for adjustment #1. This
correction factor for Scope 2 is derived from the information provided
on global internet footprint in the Smart 2020 Report, which includes
PCs in addition to telecoms and data centres.

Smart 2020 Adjustment #2:
Conversion from emissions to energy

The results available from the Smart 2020 Report are shown as
tones of carbon emitted and not in energy units (e.g. electricity
consumed kWh). The emission factors used come from McKinsey
and Vanttefall Cost Curve, which are not disclosed in the report.
Using a publicly-known global factor for the global carbon intensity
of electricity production, WRI’s CAITi, the equivalent electricity
consumption is derived as shown in Table 2.

Mobile phones accounted for 43% of the carbon footprint
of Telecoms. However, to keep the analysis focused on the
infrastructure of the cloud and related energy consumption, the
energy footprint of mobile phones will be subtracted, as PCs
(desktops and laptops) are not counted in this analysis, phones
will be also subtracted. The 270 MtCO2e without mobile phones
translates into 154 MTCO2 globally.

Smart 2020 Adjustment #3:
Top-down vs. bottom-up adjustment for data
centre energy consumption

While the Smart 2020 report did a very credible top-down
analysis of global data centre consumption, it is important to
compare this with a bottom-up approach. Based on the 2007
bottom-up analysis conducted by the US Environmental Protection
Agency (US EPA), the estimated electricity consumption of US data
centres is 1.7 times larger than the top-down analysis by the Smart
2020 report estimated for the US and Canada combined. If this factor
is to be applied to the global electricity consumption in Table 2, the
data centres portion would go from the 194.2 to 330 billion kWh
and, as consequence, the total cloud energy consumption (data
centres plus telecommunications) would be 622.6 billion
kWh -; a number that is 1.3 times larger than reported
under the Smart 2020 report.

Key trends that will impact the
environmental footprint of the cloud

Projected regional growth of data centres

Unless cloud data centres are strategically placed to utilise or be
co-developed with renewable sources of electricity, the data centre
operators are stuck with the same problem everybody has, and having
to accept the mix of clean and dirty energy sources that the electric
utilities rely upon to feed the grid.

Growth of energy-efficient data centers

More cloud-computing companies are pursuing design and siting
strategies that can reduce the energy consumption of their data
centres, primarily as a cost containment measure. For most
companies, the environmental benefits of green data design are
generally of secondary concern.

Facebook’s decision to build its own highly-efficient data centre in
Oregon that will be substantially powered by coal-fired electricity clearly
underscores the relative priority for many cloud companies. Increasing

the energy efficiency of its servers and reducing the energy footprint
of the infrastructure of data centres are clearly to be commended, but
efficiency by itself is not green if you are simply working to maximise
output from the cheapest and dirtiest energy source available. The US
EPA will soon be expanding its EnergyStar rating system to apply to
data centres, but similarly does not factor in the fuel source being used
to power the data centre in its rating criteria. Unfortunately, as our
collective demand for computing resources increases, even the most
efficiently built data centres with the highest utilisation rates serve only
to mitigate, rather than eliminate, harmful emissions.

Yahoo! Data Center (Lockport, NY)

Apple Computer (North Carolina, US)

Yahoo! is currently building a $150 million US dollar data centre near
Buffalo, New York, which will be completed in May 2010. The site was
chosen in part due to the low cooling costs expected in the region and
the ability to use fresh air cooling, as well as the ready access to low-
carbon and low-cost hydro power. The New York Power Authority has
approved 10 megawatts of low-cost hydro power for a first phase of
construction for a Yahoo! facility. A second phase, expected in the
spring of 2012, would receive an additional five megawatts of power.

Last year, Apple began construction on a $1 billion US dollar data
centre in western North Carolina, close to where Google also cited its
recent data centre investment. North Carolina’s electricity production is
high. Coal-fired power plants account for about 60% of the State’s
electricity generation, while the carbon intensity of the electricity
generation in 2005 was 561.4 gCO2e/kWh.

Cool IT

In the global fight against catastrophic climate change, global
greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector must have peaked
by 2015 and returned to current levels by 2020. Greenpeace’s Energy
[R]evolution Scenario provides a practical blueprint for the world’s
renewable energy future, and was developed in conjunction with
specialists from the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics at the
German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and more than 30 scientists and
engineers from universities, institutes and the renewable energy
industry around the world.ii

The report demonstrates how the planet can get from where we are
now, to where we need to be. It shows how the world’s carbon
emissions from the energy and transport sectors alone can peak by
2015 and be cut by over 50% by 2050. The ICT sector holds many of

the keys to reaching our climate goals by innovating solutions to
mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency.
Technologies that enable smart grids, zero emissions buildings, and
more efficient transport systems are central to efforts to combat
climate change.

The ICT sector’s abilities to lead and to innovate are the reasons
Greenpeace began its Cool IT Campaign in 2009. The campaign
uses direct company engagement and public engagement to provide
pressure on the ICT industry to put forward solutions to achieve
economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reductions and to be strong
advocates for policies that combat climate change and increase the
use of renewable energy.

Support real climate action in the United States

The flawed climate bills moving through the US Congress are riddled
with giveaways to the coal industry and made hollow by the huge
amounts of carbon offsets made available to polluters. Greenpeace
is calling on President Obama to support policies to keep global
temperatures as far below a 2°C increase as possible, compared to
pre-industrial levels, to avert catastrophic climate change by:

• Setting a goal of peaking global emissions by 2015 and be as close

to zero as possible by 2050, compared to 1990 levels;

• Cutting emissions in the US by 25% to 40% by 2020, compared to

1990 levels; and

• Joining and encouraging other members of the G8 to establish a

funding mechanism that provides $106 billion US dollars a year by
2020 to help developing countries adapt to global warming impacts
that are now unavoidable and halt tropical deforestation.

Policy recommendations
ICT should support

It is clear that as the energy demand of the cloud grows, the supply of
renewable energy must also keep pace. Additionally, because of the
unique opportunities provided to the ICT sector in a carbon-
constrained world, the industry as a whole should be advocating for
strong policies that result in economy-wide emissions reductions.
Among prime concern is priority grid access for renewable sources of
energy. Rules on grid access, transmission and cost sharing are very
often inadequate. Legislation must be clear, especially concerning cost
distribution and transmission fees. Where necessary, grid extension or
reinforcement costs should be borne by the grid operators, and shared
between all consumers, because the environmental benefits of
renewables are a public good and system operation is a natural
monopoly.

Key Principles for climate and energy policy

• Emissions reduction obligations for industrialised countries, as a
group, of at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2020, at least three
quarters of which need to be met by domestic action.

• Industrialised countries to pay for their emissions permits in order to
generate adequate and predictable funding, in the order of at least
$140 billion US dollars annually, to support clean energy and other
mitigation activities, forest protection and adaptation in developing
countries.
