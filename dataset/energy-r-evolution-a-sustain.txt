Printed on 100% post consumer recycled chlorine-free paper.Impacts of climate change are diverse and serious, and unless the 
emissions of GHGs are effectively mitigated these would threaten to 
become far more serious over time. There is now, therefore, a renewed 
interest in renewable sources of energy, because by creating and using 
low carbon substitutes to fossil fuels, we may be able to reduce emissions 
of GHGs significantly while at the same time ensuring economic growth 
and development and the enhancement of human welfare across the 
world. As it happens, there are major disparities in the levels of
consumption of energy across the world, with some countries using large 
quantities per capita and others being deprived of any sources of modern 
energy forms. Solutions in the future would, therefore, also have to come 
to grips with the reality of lack of access to modern forms of energy for 
hundreds of millions of people. For instance, there are 1.6 billion people 
in the world who have no access to electricity. Households, in which these 
people reside, therefore, lack a single electric bulb for lighting purposes,
and whatever substitutes they use provide inadequate lighting and 
environmental pollution, since these include inefficient lighting devices 
using various types of oil or the burning of candles. Future policies can be guided by the consideration of different
scenarios that can be linked to specific developments. This publication 
advocates the need for something in the nature of an energy 
revolution. This is a view that is now shared by several people across 
the world, and it is also expected that energy plans would be based on 
a clear assessment of specific scenarios related to clearly identified 
policy initiatives and technological developments. This edition of
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios provides a detailed analysis of the 
energy efficiency potential and choices in the transport sector. The 
material presented in this publication provides a useful basis for 
considering specific policies and developments that would be of value 
not only to the world but for different countries as they attempt to 
meet the global challenge confronting them. The work carried out in 
the following pages is comprehensive and rigorous, and even those 
who may not agree with the analysis presented would, perhaps,
benefit from a deep study of the underlying assumptions that are 
linked with specific energy scenarios for the future.

4GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
introduction 
Energy [R]evolution is a groundbreaking report which shows how 
the U.S. and the world can cut global warming pollution to the 
levels needed to prevent the worst effects of global warming while 
also meeting the energy needs of a growing world and phasing out
nuclear power.
Commissioned from the German Aerospace Center by Greenpeace 
and the European Renewable Energy Council, the study shows how 
the U.S. can, with off-the-shelf technology, cut CO 2emissions from 
current levels by 23 percent by 2020 and 85 percent by 2050.
The U.S. edition of the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is part of a 
series of reports which examine carefully energy needs and clean 
energy potential worldwide. Taken together, the reports are a 
blueprint for a safer climate and stronger, more sustainable economy.
For an even more detailed explication of the scenario as well as its 
application worldwide, we encourage readers to review the global
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, available at
http://www.energyblueprint.info.global warming: the challenge of our time
Global warming is a clear and present danger to America’s public 
health, economy, and environment. One record-breaking hurricane 
season follows another. Declining mountain snowpack is aggravating 
water shortages in the West. Species including the polar bear and the 
walrus are in jeopardy as a result of fast-disappearing Arctic sea ice.
California’s destructive wildfire season has become longer and more 
destructive than ever before. This is what global warming looks like.
If left unchecked, global warming will cause truly catastrophic damage.
According to the Nobel Prize-winning U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) 1, up to 30 percent of plant and animal species 
could face extinction by mid-century. Hundreds of millions of people 
worldwide including millions here in the U.S. will face severe water 
shortages. And the melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice 
sheets would trigger sea level rise of 13-20 feet or more.
The economic cost of global warming to the U.S. economy from just
four impacts—hurricane damage, water shortage, energy costs, and 
real estate losses—are projected to reach $271 billion by 2025.2

5Former World Bank chief economist Sir Nicholas Stern estimated that
global warming could reduce worldwide GDP by 20 percent.3The costs 
in terms of human lives and ecological destruction are incalculable.
Numerous studies 4,5 have concluded that to prevent catastrophic 
global warming worldwide average temperatures cannot rise by 
more than 2 degrees C (3.6ºF) above pre-industrial levels. 
To minimize the risk of catastrophic warming, we must limit
warming to 1.5 degrees C or less. Further research shows that to 
have an approximately 50 percent chance of keeping warming below 
2 degrees Celsius, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations must
stabilize below 450 parts per million (ppm). For the chances of
keeping warming below these levels to be considered “likely,” total
greenhouse gases must stabilize at 350-400 ppm or lower.6
With prudent assumptions about projected emissions in the developing 
world, IPCC 7projected that to keep greenhouse gas concentrations 
below 450 ppm developed countries as a whole would need to reduce 
emissions by 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and by 80-95 
percent by 2050. Again, to ensure the lowest possible degree of risk of
triggering catastrophic global warming, cuts in developed world 
emissions should reach the upper end of the IPCC range by 2020, and 
developed nations should aim to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. 
Given this body of science, urgent action can’t wait.
energy [r]evolution: the blueprint for a safe climate
In Energy [R]evolution, Greenpeace and the European Renewable 
Energy Council (Europe’s largest renewable energy trade 
association) posed a simple but daring series of questions.
First, is it possible, using currently available technologies, to cut
carbon dioxide ( CO 2) emissions worldwide to the levels needed to 
prevent the worst effects of global warming? Second, can we do it
while also achieving strong economic growth? Third, since the dangers 
of nuclear waste and proliferation pose similar existential threats to 
humanity as global warming itself, can we also phase out all nuclear 
power by 2050? And, finally, can we do it here in the U.S.? 
The answer, from some of the world’s top energy experts at the German 
Aerospace Center (Germany’s counterpart to National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration), is a resounding yes on all counts.
Every step of the way, we made conservative assumptions to ensure that
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario would not just add up on paper but
also work in the real world. We used numbers from the International
Energy Agency (IEA) to project economic and population growth.8The 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario assumes that only currently available, off-
the-shelf technology will be utilized between now and 2050, and unproven 
technologies like “carbon-free coal” were omitted. We assumed that no 
current energy infrastructure—from power plants to home appliances— 
will be retired prematurely. Even with these conservative assumptions, the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario demonstrates how the U.S. can transition 
to a clean energy economy and stop global warming.
By following the Energy [R]evolution blueprint, the U.S. can cut
carbon dioxide emissions from domestic fossil fuel use by 83 percent
by 2050, while still greater additional net emissions cuts can be 
achieved through changes in land use and agricultural practices.

ON GREENLAND’S COAST. 
Further, the report provides guidance for how the U.S. can achieve 
additional cuts by providing critical financing for the adoption of clean 
technologies in the developing world (see chapter 5). Finally, the U.S.
can achieve still further reductions by funding efforts to stop tropical
deforestation, which is responsible for 20 percent of worldwide global
warming emissions.9If properly implemented, these strategies together 
will allow the U.S. to achieve total cuts of at least 25 percent by 
2020 and 80-95 percent 1990 levels by 2050.
If we follow the path presented in the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario, we can solve global warming, but we must start now.
total carbon emissions reductions under energy
[r]evolution scenario
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario cuts CO 2emissions from every 
sector of the U.S. economy. Specifically:
•Electricity and steam generation emissions would drop 98 
percent from 2,538 million tons per year (MMtCO 2/yr) to 42 
MMtCO 2/yr by 2050. Electricity generation from both coal and 
oil would be phased out entirely by 2050.
•Transportation sector emissions would fall 79 percent from 
1,928 to 400 MMtCO 2/yr by 2050.
•Emissions from industry would fall 77 percent from 482 to 112 
MMtCO 2/yr by 2050.
•On a per capita basis, U.S. emissions would drop from 18.6 to 
2.1 tons/yr by 2050. For comparison, today, the developed nations of
Europe together emit 7.6 tons/yr per capita, China emits 3.4 tons/yr per 
capita, and India just 1 ton/yr per capita.
•Total emissions would decline 85 percent from current levels (83 
percent from 1990 levels) by 2050.
•Because achieving the emissions cuts demanded by the science becomes 
more costly and difficult the longer we wait, it is critical to set strong 
targets for near-term emissions reductions as well as long-term 
reductions by 2050. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, emissions 
would fall to 4,426 MMtCO 2/yr by 2020, a 12 percent reduction from 
1990 levels and a 23 percent reduction from current levels.“renewable energy, combined 
with the smart use of energy, 
can deliver half of the world’s
energy needs by 2050.”

The transportation sector is another area of tremendous potential
efficiency gains. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, the U.S. car 
fleet grows by 20 percent from the year 2000 to 2050. However, with 
highly efficient technology, including plug-in hybrid vehicles that get
100 miles per gallon or more, battery-electric powertrains, as well as 
expanded access to public transportation, the energy demand of the 
transportation sector is reduced 40 percent by 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, the U.S. would stop 
wasting energy and reap enormous efficiency gains. In contrast, the 
IEA Reference Scenario predicts that total primary energy demand 
in the U.S. will increase more than 40 percent by 2050. In the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, energy demand decreases by nearly 
24 percent compared to current consumption due to smart energy 
use and increased efficiency. 
Energy savings by sector:
•Heat supply: under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, demand for 
heat supply will grow up to 2030, but after that can even be 
reduced to below the 2015 level. Compared to the Reference 
Scenario, consumption equivalent to 6,963 PJ/yr is avoided 
through efficiency gains by 2050.
•Electricity: under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity 
demand is expected to decrease in the industry sector, but to 
grow in the transport as well as in the residential and service 
sectors. Total electricity demand will rise to 5,408 TWh/yr in the 
year 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency 
measures avoid the generation of about 2,244 TWh/yr.
•Transportation: In the transport sector, it is assumed under the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will decrease 
by 50 percent to 13,505 PJ/yr by 2050, saving 66 percent
compared to the Reference Scenario.step one: use energy smarter
The fastest, cheapest, and most effective way to cut global warming 
emissions is to simply reduce energy use. By deploying currently 
available energy efficiency technologies, the U.S. can dramatically 
cut global warming emissions while at the same time saving 
consumers and businesses money. Additionally, these savings act like 
a massive economy-wide tax cut, stimulating further economic 
growth and job creation.
For example, consider the tremendous potential for emission 
reductions through energy efficiency in home heating and cooling,
which accounts for almost half of home energy use.10 Drafty 
windows, poor insulation, and other air leaks waste vast amounts of
energy. In fact, the Department of Energy’s home weatherization 
program cuts energy use for heating and cooling by an average of
30 percent per home.11 By expanding this program nationwide, the 
U.S. could cut household energy use by 30 percent nationally and 
save $1.50 for every dollar invested. Similarly dramatic 
improvements are currently available from super-efficient air 
conditioners, water heaters, and appliances.GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

step two: repower america with clean energy
The U.S. today is heavily dependent on polluting fossil fuels for 
electricity. Nearly 71 percent of U.S. electricity comes from fossil
fuels, including 53 percent from coal. Of the remainder, 21 percent
is generated from nuclear power, 15 percent from natural gas, 7 
percent from hydro and less than 2 percent from other renewable 
sources. As a result, the U.S. emits 2,557 MMtCO 2from the 
production of electricity and steam every year.
Under the IEA Reference Scenario, U.S. dependence on fossil fuels 
increases still further, and emissions from electricity and steam 
generation grow 52 percent to 3,769 MMtCO 2, an emissions 
increase that would, if replicated by other countries, make 
catastrophic global warming impacts virtually certain.
However, this is a wholly avoidable fate. The U.S. can repower with 
renewable, clean energy. For example, the five states of North 
Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Montana and Texas have enough wind 
energy potential to meet the electricity needs of the entire country,
and Nevada could do the same with solar thermal plants covering 
only 9 percent of the state’s land area.12 Off-shore wind could 
produce nearly as much energy as all U.S. electricity generators 
combined.13 Solar panels installed on all U.S. rooftops could provide 
more than 70 percent of current total generation capacity.14 
Obviously these are hypothetical scenarios—land use issues,
technological and structural limitations and other challenges make it
impossible to capture and use 100 percent of the theoretical potential
from any renewable energy source. However, even after accounting for 
these restrictions, the amount of energy that can be accessed using 
current technologies from wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, biomass, and 
ocean energy could supply 5.9 times current global demand.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, the aggressive ramp-up of
clean energy sources combined with efficiency gains discussed in 
step one drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Highlights of
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario include:
•Wind power capacity would grow from 8 gigawatts (GW) in 2005 
to 398 GW in 2050, an increase from less than 1 percent to 26 
percent of total U.S. capacity by 2050.
•Solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity would rise from 0.01 GW in 2005 
to 511 GW in 2050, 33 percent of total capacity in that year.
•Solar thermal plants, which have the potential to store energy 
and be used as base-load power, would increase from 0.3 to 148 
GW, 9.6 percent of total U.S. energy capacity. Solar power 
overall would provide 43 percent of total capacity.
•Combined capacity from geothermal, biomass, and ocean energy 
would rise from 7 GW in 2005 to 281 GW in 2050, 18 percent
of total U.S. energy capacity.
•Energy generation from natural gas would play an important role 
in the transition to a clean energy economy. Supply from natural
gas would rise from 340 GW in 2005 to a peak of 505 GW in 
2030 before declining to 80 GW in 2050 as renewable energy 
technologies fully mature.
•Energy generation from coal, oil, and nuclear power would be 
completely phased out in the generation of electricity by 2050.It is important to note that all power plants under the Energy 
[R]evolution scenario are phased out over the course of their 
typical depreciation period, about 40 years. Most coal plants in the 
U.S. are already near or past their 40th birthday. In contrast, many 
natural gas plants in the U.S. were built over the last decade.

fossil fuels: penny-wise, pound-foolish 
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario shows us what the old axiom 
“penny-wise and pound-foolish” really means. Under the Reference 
Scenario, the rising costs of fossil fuels and lost savings from 
energy efficiency will far outstrip the up-front investment costs 
needed to achieve the clean energy future envisioned here. 
The total investment required to achieve the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario from 2005-2030 is just under $2.8 trillion, about $1.1 
trillion more than what would be needed to meet America’s energy 
needs under the Reference Scenario.
However, because the fuel costs of renewable energy and energy 
efficiency are zero, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario will bring 
enormous savings overall. The total fuel cost for fossil fuels in the 
Reference Scenario between 2005-2030 amounts to $10.85 
trillion, compared to $8.7 trillion in the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario, a savings of $2.089 trillion.
Bottom line, the long-term savings in fuel costs are nearly 
double the additional up-front investment required to achieve 
the Energy [R]evolution.
If one includes the staggering economic costs of unchecked global
warming, the economic advantages of the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario are beyond question.
a win-win scenario: stop global warming 
and create millions of new jobs
The Energy [R]evolution will not only help ensure a safer climate— 
it will also spark an explosion of good new jobs that can never be 
moved over seas. The scenario will create all kinds of new jobs all
over the country, from agricultural workers at biomass plants in the 
Midwest to “Rust Belt” workers building wind turbines to 
accountants and other white collar employees all across the country.
By contrast, coal is one of the least job-intensive industries in America.
According to the University of Massachusetts’s Political Economy 
Research Institute, investments in wind and solar power create 2.8 
times as many jobs as the same investment in coal; mass transit and 
conservation would create 3.8 times as many jobs as coal.15 
Using frequently cited job creation models, Greenpeace projects 
that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario will create a net of over 
14.5 million new jobs by 2050 in the energy efficiency and 
renewable energy sectors alone. (Because of insufficient data, job 
gains from biomass and hydroelectric power, as well as the 
transportation sector, were not calculated.) moving from ideas to action 
to implement the energy [r]evolution scenario, 
the following policy changes are recommended:
1.Enact “cap and auction” legislation to reduce U.S. global
warming pollution emissions to science-based levels needed to 
minimize the risk of catastrophic global warming.
2.End all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.
3.Set mandatory efficiency standards for all energy consuming 
appliances, buildings and vehicles.
4.Establish binding targets for renewable energy generation.
5.Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to 
the electricity grid for renewable power generators.
6.Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example 
through renewable energy payments (also known as feed-in 
tariff) programs.
7.Implement consumer transparency measures to provide more 
information about the environmental impacts of consumer 
products and energy sources.
8.Increase funding for research and development of renewable 
energy and energy efficiency.GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

3.implement clean, renewable solutions and energy systems. 
There is no energy shortage. All we need to do is use existing 
technologies to harness energy effectively and efficiently.
Renewable energy and energy efficiency measures are ready,
viable and increasingly competitive. Wind, solar and other 
renewable energy technologies have experienced double-digit
market growth for the past decade.
Sustainable decentralized energy systems powered by renewable 
energy produce less carbon emissions, are cheaper and involve 
less dependence on imported fuel. Renewable energy systems 
create jobs and empower local communities. Decentralized 
systems are more secure and more efficient. This is what the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario aims to create.
4.decouple growth from fossil fuel use. Starting in the 
developed countries, economic growth must fully decouple from 
fossil fuels. It is a fallacy to suggest that economic growth must
be predicated on their increased combustion.
We need to use the energy we produce much more efficiently, and we 
need to make the transition to renewable energy – away from fossil
fuels – quickly in order to enable clean and sustainable growth.
5.phase out dirty, unsustainable energy. The U.S. needs to phase 
out coal and nuclear power. This country cannot continue to 
build coal plants at a time when global warming emissions pose 
a real and present danger to both ecosystems and people. And 
we cannot continue to ignore nuclear risks. There is no role for 
nuclear power in the Energy [R]evolution.
transitioning to clean energy
In 2005, renewable energy sources accounted for 13 percent of the 
world’s primary energy demand. Biomass, which is mostly used for 
heating, is the main renewable energy source. The share of
renewable energy in electricity generation was 18 percent. The 
contribution of renewable energy to primary energy demand for 
heat supply was around 24 percent. About 80 percent of primary 
energy supply today still comes from fossil fuels, and 6 percent
from nuclear power.24 The climate crisis demands nothing short of an energy revolution.
This chapter summarizes the basic principles and goals underlying 
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.
key principles of the energy [r]evolution 
Current electricity generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels,
with their associated CO 2emissions, in very large power stations 
which waste much of their primary input energy. More energy is 
lost as power is moved around the electricity grid and converted 
from high transmission voltage down to a supply suitable for 
domestic or commercial consumers. The system is innately 
vulnerable to disruption: localized technical, weather-related or even 
deliberately caused faults can quickly cascade, resulting in 
widespread blackouts. Whichever technology is used to generate 
electricity within this old fashioned configuration, it will inevitably 
be subject to some, or all, of these problems.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario represents a major change in the 
way that energy is both produced and distributed. The scenario sets 
out to fulfill the following goals:
1.achieve science-based emissions reductions to minimize 
climate risk. There is only so much carbon that the atmosphere 
can absorb. Each year we emit over 25 billion tons of CO 2; we 
are literally filling up the sky. Coal supplies could provide several
hundred years of fuel, but coal and oil development must be 
ended to stay with safe CO 2emission limits. The Energy 
[R]evolution Scenario aims to reduce energy-related CO 2
emissions to a maximum of 10 Gt (gigatons) by 2050 and phase 
out fossil fuels worldwide by 2085.
2.ensure equity and fairness. We must ensure a fair distribution 
of benefits and costs within societies and between nations. At
one extreme, a third of the world’s population has no access to 
electricity, while the most industrialized countries consume much 
more than their fair share. The effects of climate change on the 
poorest communities are exacerbated by massive global energy 
inequality. If we are to address climate change, one of the 
principles must be equity and fairness, so that the benefits of
energy services—such as light, heat, power and transport—are 
available for all: north and south, rich and poor. Only in this way 
can we create true energy security, as well as the conditions for 
genuine human wellbeing. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario 
aims to achieve energy equity as soon as technically possible. By 
2050, average global per capita carbon dioxide should be 
between 1 and 2 tons.

“we should not wait, we cannot wait, we must not wait, we have
everything we need - save perhaps political will. and in our
democracy, political will is a renewable resource.”
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE 
©G.POROPAT/DREAMSTIME1

The time is right to make substantial structural changes in the 
electricity sector within the next decade. Many power plants in the U.S.
are nearing retirement; more than half of all operating power plants 
across the industrialized world are over 20 years old. At the same time 
developing countries, such as China, India and Brazil, are looking to 
satisfy the growing energy demand created by expanding economies.
Within the next ten years, the U.S. will decide whether to meet
demand with fossil and nuclear fuels or with the efficient use of
renewable energy. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario is based on a 
new political framework in favor of renewable energy and 
cogeneration combined with energy efficiency.
To make this happen, both renewable energy and cogeneration—on 
a large scale and through decentralized, smaller units—have to 
grow faster than overall global energy demand. Both approaches 
must replace old generating technologies and deliver the additional
energy required in the developing world.
It is not possible to switch immediately from the current large-scale 
fossil and nuclear fuel based energy supply to a renewable energy 
supply. A transition phase is required to build up the necessary 
infrastructure. While remaining firmly committed to the promotion 
of renewable sources of energy, Greenpeace appreciates that gas,
used in appropriately scaled cogeneration plants, is a necessary 
transition fuel, and will drive cost-effective decentralization of U.S.
energy infrastructure. With warmer summers, tri-generation, which 
incorporates heat-fired absorption chillers to deliver cooling 
capacity in addition to heat and power, will also become a 
particularly valuable means to achieve emissions reductions.
a development pathway
The Energy [R]evolution envisages a development pathway which 
turns the present energy supply structure into a sustainable system.
There are two main stages to this.
step 1: energy efficiency 
The Energy [R]evolution aims to aggressively exploit the potential
for energy efficiency in the U.S. It focuses on current best practices 
and new technologies which will become available in the future,
assuming continuous innovation. Energy savings are equally 
distributed over the three sectors – industry, transport and 
domestic/business. Intelligent use, not abstinence, is the basic 
philosophy for future energy conservation.
The most important energy-saving options are: improved heat
insulation and building design; super-efficient appliances and 
electronic devices; replacement of old style electrical heating systems 
with renewable heat production (such as solar collectors); and a 
reduction in energy consumption by vehicles used for goods and 
passenger traffic. Industrialized countries, which currently use energy 
in the most inefficient way, can reduce energy consumption drastically 
without the loss of either housing comfort or entertainment
electronics. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario uses energy saved in 
developed countries as a compensation for the increasing power 
requirements in developing countries. The ultimate goal is stabilization of global energy consumption within the next two 
decades. At the same time, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario aims to 
create “energy equity” by shifting wasted energy in industrialized 
countries towards a fair, worldwide energy supply distribution.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario makes a dramatic reduction in 
primary energy demand compared to the IEA’s “ Reference 
Scenario” – but with the same GDP and population development.
This is a crucial prerequisite for renewable energy growth in the 
overall energy supply system and will help compensate for the 
phase-out of nuclear energy and fossil fuels.
step 2: deliver clean energy to power a growing world 
decentralized energy and large-scale renewables In order to 
achieve higher fuel efficiencies and reduce distribution losses, the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario makes extensive use of Decentralized 
Energy (DE). This is energy generated at or near the point of use.
DE is connected to a local distribution network system, supplying 
homes and offices, rather than the high voltage transmission system.
The proximity of electricity generating plant to consumers allows any 
waste heat from combustion processes to be piped to buildings 
nearby, a system known as cogeneration or combined heat and power.
DE uses nearly all the input energy, unlike traditional centralized 
fossil fuel plants, which use only a fraction of input energy.
DE can also include stand-alone systems, separate from public 
networks, like heat pumps, solar thermal panels or biomass heating 
systems. These can all be commercialized to provide sustainable low 
emission heating. Although DE technologies can be considered 
‘disruptive’ because they do not fit the existing electricity market
and system, with appropriate changes they have the potential for 
exponential growth.
By 2050, a large proportion of global energy will be produced by 
decentralized energy sources. Large-scale renewable energy supply 
will still be needed in order to achieve a fast transition to a 
renewables-dominated energy system. Large offshore wind farms 
and concentrated solar power (CSP) plants in sunbelt regions are 
prime examples of the technologies that will be needed.
cogeneration The increased use of combined heat and power 
generation (CHP) will improve energy supply efficiency, whether 
using natural gas or biomass. In the longer term, decreasing 
demand for heat and the ability to produce heat directly from 
renewable energy sources will limit the further expansion of CHP.
renewable electricity The electricity sector will pioneer renewable 
energy utilization in the U.S. All renewable electricity technologies 
are experiencing steady growth, and over the past 20-30 years have 
grown up to 35 percent annually. By 2050, the majority of electricity 
will be produced from renewable energy sources. Expected growth of
electricity use in the transportation sector will further promote the 
use of renewable power generation technologies.GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

11 optimized integration of renewable energy Modification of the 
energy system will be necessary to accommodate the significantly 
higher shares of renewable energy expected under the Energy 
[R]evolution Scenario. This is not unlike the 1970s and 1980s,
when the U.S. experienced unprecedented growth in the energy 
sector. In addition to building centralized power plants, the U.S.
constructed high-voltage power lines, night storage heaters, and 
installed large electric-powered hot water boilers to sell the 
electricity produced by nuclear and coal-fired plants at night.
Several developed countries have demonstrated that it is possible to 
smoothly integrate a large proportion of decentralized energy,
including variable sources such as wind. For example, Denmark has 
the highest percentage of combined heat and power generation and 
wind power in Europe. With strong political support for renewable 
energy, 50 percent of electricity and 80 percent of district heat in 
Denmark is now supplied by cogeneration plants. Wind power 
contributes more than 18 percent of Danish electricity demand. At
certain times, electricity generation from cogeneration and wind 
turbines even exceeds demand. In Denmark, grid stability is managed 
both through regulating the capacity of large power stations and 
through energy imports and exports to neighboring countries. A 
three-tier tariff system enables power generation balancing from 
decentralized power plants that provide daily electricity consumption.
It is important to optimize the energy system as a whole through 
intelligent management by both producers and consumers, by an 
appropriate mix of power stations and through new systems for 
storing electricity.renewable heating In the heat supply sector, the contribution of
renewables will increase significantly. Growth rates are expected to 
be similar to those of the renewable electricity sector. Fossil fuels 
will be increasingly replaced by more efficient modern technologies,
in particular biomass, solar collectors and geothermal. By 2050,
renewable energy technologies will satisfy the majority of heating 
and cooling demand.
transport Before new technologies such as hybrid or electric cars 
or new bio fuels can play a substantial role in the transport sector,
existing efficiency potentials must be exploited. In the Energy 
[R]evolution Scenario, biomass is primarily committed to stationary 
applications; the use of bio fuels for transport is limited by the 
availability of sustainably grown biomass. Electric vehicles will play 
an even more important role in improving energy efficiency in 
transport and substituting for fossil fuels. 
Overall, for renewable energy sources to achieve economically 
attractive growth, a balanced and timely mobilization of all
technologies is essential. Such a mobilization depends on resource 
availability, potential for cost-reduction, and technological maturity.
In addition to technology-driven solutions, lifestyle changes - like 
simply driving less and using public transport – have a huge 
potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.the energy [r]evolution |A DECENTRALIZED ENERGY FUTURE 1

A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
12 energy storage Another method of balancing out electricity supply 
and demand is through intermediate storage. Intermediate storage 
can be decentralized, for example by the use of batteries, or 
centralized. To date, pumped storage hydro power stations are most
often used to store large amounts of electric power. In a pumped 
storage system, energy from power generation is stored in a lake 
and then allowed to flow back when required, driving turbines and 
generating electricity. Intermediate storage already provides an 
important contribution to energy security, and 280 pumped storage 
plants exist worldwide. 
In the long term, other storage solutions are needed. One promising 
solution is the use of compressed air. In this storage system,
electricity is used to compress air into deep salt domes .37 miles 
underground and at pressures of up to 1015,26 pounds per square 
inch. When electricity demand peaks, the compressed air is allowed 
to flow back out of the cavern and drive a turbine. Although this 
system, known as CAES (Compressed Air Energy Storage), currently 
still requires fossil fuel auxiliary power, a so-called “adiabatic” plant
is being developed which does not require fossil fuel. To achieve this,
the heat from the compressed air is intermediately stored in a giant
heat store. Such a power station can achieve a storage efficiency of
70 percent. Most exciting, paired with these energy storage 
technologies, solar thermal plants have the potential to become truly 
clean, renewable base-load power.
forecasting The forecasting of renewable electricity generation is 
also continually improving. Regulating supply is particularly 
expensive when it has to be found at short notice. However,
prediction techniques for wind power generation have become 
considerably more accurate in recent years and are still being 
improved. The demand for balancing supply will therefore decrease 
in the future.appropriate power station mix The right combination of power 
sources is essential to implement the Energy [R]evolution Scenario 
in the U.S. Modern gas power stations, unlike coal or nuclear power 
stations, are not only highly efficient but easier to regulate for 
fluctuating energy supply into the grid. Coal and nuclear power 
stations have lower fuel and operating costs, but comparably high 
investment costs. Coal and nuclear power stations must run around 
the clock as ‘base load’ in order to earn back their investment and 
take hours to bring up to full speed. Gas-fired power stations have 
lower investment costs and are profitable even at low output,
making them suitable to balance out the variations in energy supply 
from renewable sources.
By contrast, renewable electricity generation systems can also be 
involved in supply optimization. Wind farms, for example, can be 
temporarily switched off when too much power is available on the 
network or scaled down incrementally by adjusting the angle of 
the turbines.
load management Electricity demand can be managed by 
providing consumers with financial incentives to reduce or shut off
their supply at periods of peak consumption. Control technology can 
be used to manage the arrangement and is already used to assist
large industrial customers. For example, a Norwegian power 
supplier sends private household customers a text message with a 
signal to shut down during peak times. Each household can decide 
in advance whether or not they want to participate. In Germany,
experiments are being conducted with time-flexible tariffs so that
washing machines operate at night and refrigerators turn off
temporarily during periods of high demand.
This type of load management has been simplified by advances in 
communications technology. For example, Italy installed 30 million 
innovative electricity counters to allow remote meter-reading and 
control of consumer and service information. Many household 
electrical products or systems, such as refrigerators, dishwashers,
washing machines, storage heaters, water pumps and air conditioning,
can be managed either by temporary shut-off or by rescheduling their 
time of operation, thus freeing up electricity supply for other uses.1

the energy [r]evolution |HOW THE ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION WAS CREATED 
13 the “virtual power station” 25 The rapid development of information 
technologies is helping to pave the way for a decentralized energy 
supply based on cogeneration plants, renewable energy systems and 
conventional power stations. Manufacturers of small cogeneration 
plants already offer Internet interfaces which enable remote control
of the system. It is now possible for individual householders to 
control their electricity and heat usage so that expensive electricity 
drawn from the grid can be minimized—and electricity demand 
stabilized. This is part of the trend towards the ‘smart house’ where 
a mini cogeneration plant becomes a day-to-day energy 
management center.
We can go one step further than this with a ‘virtual power station.’
‘Virtual’ does not mean that real energy isn’t generated. Instead,
the hub of the power station is a control unit which processes data 
from many decentralized power stations, compares them with 
demand predictions, generation and weather conditions, retrieves 
available power market prices, and then intelligently optimizes the 
overall power station activity. Some public utilities already use such 
systems to integrate cogeneration plants, wind farms, photovoltaic 
systems and other power plants. The virtual power station can also 
connect consumers directly to the power management process.
how the energy [r]evolution scenario was created 
To achieve the dramatic emissions cuts needed to avoid climate 
change will require a massive uptake of renewable energy. In the 
U.S., renewable energy targets must be greatly expanded both to 
substitute for fossil fuel and nuclear generation and to create the 
necessary economy of scale for global expansion. Within the Energy 
[R]evolution Scenario we assume that modern renewable energy 
sources, such as solar collectors, solar cookers and modern forms 
of bio energy, will replace inefficient, traditional biomass use.
Moving from principles to action for a secure, clean energy supply and 
climate change mitigation requires a long-term perspective. Energy 
infrastructure takes time to build, and new energy technologies take 
time to develop. Policy shifts often need many years to have an effect.
Therefore, any analysis that seeks to tackle energy and environmental
issues needs to look ahead at least half a century.
Scenarios are important in describing possible development paths,
to give decision-makers an overview of future perspectives, and to 
indicate how far they can shape the future energy system. Two 
different scenarios are used here to characterize the wide range of
possible paths for the future energy supply system: a Reference 
Scenario, reflecting a continuation of current trends and policies,
and the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, designed to achieve a set of
dedicated environmental policy targets.The reference scenario is based on the Reference Scenario 
published by the International Energy Agency in World Energy 
Outlook 2007 (WEO 2007). (IEA recently released WEO 2008,
however too late for use in in this study.) 26 The Reference Scenario 
only takes existing international energy and environmental policies 
into account. The assumptions include, for example, continuing 
progress in electricity and gas market reforms, the liberalization of
cross-border energy trade and new policies designed to combat
environmental pollution. The Reference Scenario does not include 
additional policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As the IEA 
Reference Scenario only forecasts energy growth to 2030,
Greenpeace extended the Reference Scenario to 2050 by 
extrapolating its key macroeconomic indicators. This provides a 
baseline for comparison with the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.
The energy [r]evolution scenario has a key target for the reduction 
of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions down to a level of around 10 
gigatons per year by 2050 to meet science-based levels necessary to 
reduce the risk of catastrophic global warming. A second objective is 
a global phase-out of nuclear energy. To achieve these goals, the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario proposes an ambitious plan to fully 
exploit the large potential for energy efficiency. At the same time, all
cost-effective renewable energy sources are used for heat, electricity 
generation, and the production of bio fuels. The general framework 
parameters for population and GDP growth remain unchanged from 
the Reference Scenario.
These scenarios do not claim to predict the future; they simply 
describe two potential development paths out of the broad range of
possible ‘futures’. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario is designed as 
a roadmap for the efforts and actions required to achieve its 
ambitious objectives and as an illustration of the options we have 
at hand to create a sustainable energy supply system. 
scenario background The scenarios in this report were jointly 
commissioned by Greenpeace and the European Renewable Energy 
Council from the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics, part of the 
German Aerospace Center (DLR). The supply scenarios were 
calculated using the MESAP/PlaNet simulation model used for the 
previous Energy [R]evolution study.27 Energy demand projections 
were developed by Ecofys Netherlands, based on an analysis of the 
future potential for energy efficiency measures. The biomass 
potential, using Greenpeace sustainability criteria, has been 
developed especially for this scenario by the German Biomass 1

Research Centre. The future development pathway for car 
technologies is based on a special report produced in 2008 by the 
Institute of Vehicle Concepts, DLR for Greenpeace International.
The aim of the Ecofys study was to develop a low energy demand 
scenario for the period 2005 to 2050 for the IEA regions as 
defined in the World Energy Outlook report series. Calculations 
were made for each decade from 2010 onwards. Energy demand 
was split up into electricity and fuels. The Ecofys study took the 
following sectors into account: industry, transport, and consumers,
including households and services.
Under the low energy demand scenario, worldwide final energy 
demand is reduced by 38 percent in 2050 in comparison to the 
Reference Scenario, resulting in a final energy demand of 350 EJ 
(ExaJoules). The energy savings are equally distributed over the 
three sectors of industry, transport and other uses. The most
important energy saving methods are efficient passenger and freight
transport and improved heat insulation and building design. 
The Institute of Vehicle Concepts (IVC) in Stuttgart, Germany 
developed a global scenario for cars covering ten world regions. The 
goal was to produce a demanding but feasible scenario to lower 
global car CO 2emissions within the context of the Energy 
[R]evolution Scenario. The IVC approach takes into account a vast
range of technical measures to reduce vehicle energy consumption,but also considers the dramatic increase in vehicle ownership and 
annual mileage taking place in developing countries. In addition, the 
IVC examined vehicle technology, alternative fuels, changes in sales 
of different vehicle sizes (segment split) and changes in usage and 
driving distances (modal split).
The scenario assumes that a large share of renewable electricity 
will be available in the future. A combination of ambitious efforts 
towards higher efficiency in vehicle technologies, a major switch to 
grid-connected electric vehicles, and incentives for vehicle users to 
save carbon dioxide lead to the conclusion that it is possible to 
reduce CO 2emissions from ‘well-to-wheel’ in 2050 by roughly 25 
percent28 compared to 1990 and 40 percent compared to 2005.
Under the scenario, by 2050, 60 percent of the energy used in 
transport will still come from fossil fuels, mainly gasoline and 
diesel. Renewable electricity will provide 25 percent of transport
energy needs, bio fuels 13 percent, and hydrogen will provide 2 
percent by 2050. However, total global energy consumption in 2050 
will be similar to 2005 consumption levels, in spite of enormous 
increases in fuel use in some regions of the world. 
The peak in global CO 2emissions from transport occurs between 2010 
and 2015. From 2010 onwards, new legislation in the US and Europe 
will help break the upwards trend in emissions. From 2020 onwards, the 
effect of introducing grid-connected electric cars can be clearly seen.

the energy [r]evolution |SCENARIO PRINCIPLES 1

15 The issue of energy security is now at the top of the U.S. policy 
agenda. Concern is focused both on price stability and the security 
of physical supply. At present, around 80 percent of global energy 
demand is met by fossil fuels. There is an unrelenting increase in 
energy demand, yet finite energy sources. This chapter, based partly 
on the report ‘Plugging the Gap,29 examines the potential sources of
energy to meet the world’s growing energy needs.
oil
Oil is the lifeblood of the modern global economy, as the effects of
the supply disruptions of the 1970s made clear. Oil provides 36 
percent of the world’s energy needs and is the fuel employed almost
exclusively for essential uses such as transportation. However, a 
passionate debate has developed over the ability of supply to meet
increasing consumption, a debate obscured by poor information and 
stirred by unstable oil prices.
the reserves chaos
Public data about oil and gas reserves is strikingly inconsistent and 
potentially unreliable for legal, commercial, historical and 
sometimes political reasons. The most widely available and quoted 
figures, those from industry journals like Oil & Gas Journal and 
World Oil, have limited value as they report the reserve figures 
provided by companies and governments without analysis or 
verification. Moreover, as there is no agreed definition of reserves or 
standard reporting practice, these figures usually stand for different
physical and conceptual magnitudes. Confusing terminology 
(‘proved’, ‘probable’, ‘possible’, ‘recoverable’, ‘reasonable certainty’) 
only adds to the problem.
Historically, private oil companies have consistently underestimated 
their reserves to comply with conservative stock exchange rules and 
to provide a conservative resource estimate in the marketplace.
When an oil discovery is made, often just a portion of the 
geologist’s estimate of recoverable resources is reported and 
subsequent reporting may increase the reserves from that same oil
field over time. On the other hand, national oil companies, mostly 
represented by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC), are not subject to any reporting standards. In the late 
1980s, OPEC countries blatantly overstated their reserves while 
competing for production quotas, which were allocated as a 
proportion of the reserves. Although some revision was needed after 
the companies were nationalized, between 1985 and 1990, OPEC 
countries increased their joint reserves by 82 percent. Not only 
were these dubious revisions never corrected, but many of these 
countries have reported untouched reserves for years, even if no 
sizeable discoveries were made and production continued at the same pace. Additionally, the Former Soviet Union’s oil and gas 
reserves have been overestimated by about 30 percent because the 
original assessments were later misinterpreted.
While private companies are now becoming more realistic about the 
extent of their resources, the OPEC countries hold by far the majority 
of the reported reserves, and information on their resources is as 
unsatisfactory as ever. In brief, these information sources should be 
treated with considerable caution. To fairly estimate the world’s oil
resources a regional assessment of the mean backdated (i.e.
‘technical’) discoveries would need to be performed.
natural gas
Natural gas has been the fastest-growing fossil energy source in the 
U.S. and comprises an increasing share among electricity 
generation fuels. Gas is generally regarded as an abundant
resource, and public concerns about depletion are limited to oil,
even though few in-depth studies address the subject. Gas resources 
are very concentrated, and a few massive fields make up most of
the reserves. The largest gas field in the world holds 15 percent of
the ‘Ultimate Recoverable Resources’ (URR), compared to 6 
percent for oil. Unfortunately, information about gas resources 
suffers from the same bad practices as oil data, because gas mostly 
comes from the same geological formations, and the same 
stakeholders are involved.
Most reserves are initially understated and then gradually revised 
upwards, giving an optimistic impression of growth. By contrast,
Russia’s reserves, the largest in the world, are considered to have 
been overestimated by about 30 percent. Owing to geological
similarities, gas follows the same depletion dynamic as oil, and thus 
the same discovery and production cycles. In fact, existing data for 
gas is of worse quality than for oil, with ambiguities arising over 
the amount produced partly because flared and vented gas is not
always accounted for. As opposed to published reserves, the 
technical ones have been almost constant since 1980 because 
discoveries have roughly matched production.
coal
Coal was the world’s largest source of energy until it was overtaken 
by oil in the 1960s. Today, coal supplies almost one-quarter of the 
world’s energy. Despite being the most abundant of fossil fuels, the 
continued use of coal is currently threatened by environmental

concerns. Coal reserves are abundant and more equally distributed 
throughout the world than oil and gas. Global recoverable reserves 
are the largest of all fossil fuels, and most countries have at least
some. Moreover, existing and prospective big energy consumers like 
the U.S., China and India are self-sufficient in coal and will be for 
the foreseeable future. Coal has been exploited on a large scale for 
two centuries, so both the product and the available resources are 
well known, and no substantial new deposits are expected to be 
discovered. In the future, the world will likely consume 20 percent
of its current reserves by 2030 and 40 percent by 2050. Therefore,
even if current trends are maintained, coal supplies would still last
several hundred years.
nuclear
Uranium, the fuel used in nuclear power plants, is a finite resource 
whose economically available reserves are limited. Its distribution is 
almost as concentrated as oil and does not match regional
consumption. Five countries - Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan,
Russia and Niger - control three quarters of the world’s supply. As 
a significant user of uranium, however, Russia’s reserves will be 
exhausted within ten years.
Secondary sources, such as old deposits, currently make up nearly 
half of worldwide uranium reserves. However, those will soon be 
used up. Mining capacities will have to be nearly doubled in the 
next few years to meet current needs.
A joint report by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that all existing 
nuclear power plants will have used up their nuclear fuel, employing 
current technology, within less than 70 years.30 Given the range of
scenarios for the worldwide development of nuclear power, it is 
likely that uranium supplies will be exhausted sometime between 
2026 and 2070. This forecast includes the use of mixed oxide fuel
(MOX), a mixture of uranium and plutonium.
renewable energy
Nature offers a variety of freely available options for producing 
energy. Their exploitation is mainly a question of how to convert
sunlight, wind, biomass or water into electricity, heat or power as 
efficiently, sustainably and cost-effectively as possible.
On average, the energy in the sunshine that reaches the Earth is 
about one kilowatt per square meter worldwide. According to the 
Research Association for Solar Power, power is gushing from 
renewable energy sources at a rate of 2,850 times more energy than 
is needed in the world. In one day, the sunlight which reaches the 
Earth produces enough energy to satisfy the world’s current power 
requirements for eight years. Even though only a percentage of that
potential is technically accessible, this is still enough to provide just
under six times more power than the world currently requires.definition of types of energy resource potential31
theoretical potential The theoretical potential identifies the 
physical upper limit of the energy available from a certain source.
For solar energy, for example, this would be the total solar 
radiation falling on a particular surface.
conversion potential The conversion potential is derived from the 
annual efficiency of the respective conversion technology. It is 
therefore not a strictly defined value, since the efficiency of a 
particular technology depends on technological progress.
technical potential The technical potential takes into account
additional restrictions regarding the area that is realistically 
available for energy generation. Technological, structural and 
ecological restrictions, as well as legislative requirements, are 
accounted for.
economic potential The proportion of the technical potential that
can be utilized economically. For biomass, for example, those 
quantities are included that can be exploited economically in 
competition with other products and land uses.
sustainable potential This limits the potential of an energy source 
based on evaluation of ecological and socio-economic factors.2the world’s energy resources |NUCLEAR, RENEWABLE ENERGY

17 renewable energy potential by region and technology
Based on the report ‘Renewable Energy Potentials’ from REN 21, a 
global policy network,32 the Energy [R]evolution Scenario can 
provide a more detailed overview of renewable energy prospects by 
world region and technology. 
Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology can be harnessed almost
everywhere, and its technical potential is estimated at over 1,500 
EJ/year, closely followed by concentrating solar thermal power 
(CSP). These two cannot simply be added together, however,
because they would require much of the same land resources.
Onshore wind potential is equally vast, with almost 400 EJ/year 
available beyond the future electricity consumption. The estimate 
for offshore wind potential (22 EJ/year) is cautious, as only wind 
intensive areas on ocean shelf areas, with a relatively shallow water 
depth, outside shipping lines and protected areas, are included.
Various ocean or marine energy potentials also reach a similar 
magnitude, mostly from ocean waves. Cautious estimates reach a 
figure of around 50 EJ/year. The estimates for hydro and 
geothermal (energy generated from the Earth’s natural heat) 
resources are well established, each having a technical potential of
around 50 EJ/year. To put these figures in context, current global
energy demand of around 500 EJ.In terms of heating and cooling, using direct geothermal energy also 
has great potential to meet and exceed current world energy demand 
for heat. The potential for solar heating, including passive solar 
building design, is virtually limitless. However, heat is costly to 
transport, and one should only consider geothermal heat and solar 
water heating potentials which are sufficiently close to the point of
consumption. Passive solar technology, which contributes enormously 
to the provision of heating services, is not considered as a supply 
source in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, but as an efficiency 
factor to be taken into account in energy demand forecasts.2the world’s energy resources |RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL

18 GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
the global potential for sustainable biomass
As part of background research for the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario, Greenpeace commissioned the German Biomass Research 
Centre, the former Institute for Energy and Environment, to 
investigate the worldwide potential for energy crops in different
scenarios up to 2050. In addition, information has been compiled 
from scientific studies of the worldwide potential and from data 
derived from state of the art remote sensing techniques such as 
satellite images.
Various studies have looked historically at the potential for bio 
energy and come up with widely differing results. Comparison 
between them is difficult because they use different definitions of
the various biomass resource fractions. This problem is particularly 
significant in relation to forest derived biomass. Most research has 
focused almost exclusively on energy crops, as their development is 
considered to be more significant for satisfying the demand for bio energy. The result is that the potential for using forest residues 
(wood left over after harvesting) is often underestimated.
Data from eighteen studies were examined, with a concentration on 
those studies which report the potential for biomass residues.
Among these there were ten comprehensive assessments with more 
or less detailed documentation of the methodology. The majority 
focus on the long-term potential for 2050 and 2100. Little 
information is available for 2020 and 2030. Most of the studies 
were published within the last ten years. Figure 2.2 shows the 
variations in potential by biomass type from the different studies.
Looking at the contribution of individual resources to the total
biomass potential, the majority of studies agree that the most
promising resource is energy crops from dedicated plantations. Only 
six give a regional breakdown, however, and only a few quantify all
types of residues separately. Quantifying the potential of minor 
fractions, such as animal residues and organic wastes, is difficult, 
as the data are relatively poor.sourceREN21 table 2.2: technical renewable energy potential by region

19 potential of energy crops
Apart from the utilization of biomass from waste, the cultivation of
energy crops in agricultural production systems is of greatest
significance. The technical potential for growing energy crops was 
calculated on the assumption that demand for food takes priority.
As a first step the demand for arable and grassland for food 
production has been calculated for each of 133 countries in 
different scenarios. These scenarios are:
•Business as usual (BAU) scenario: Present agricultural activity 
continues for the foreseeable future.
•Basic scenario: No forest clearing; reduced use of fallow areas for 
agriculture.
•Sub-scenario 1: Basic scenario plus expanded ecological
protection areas and reduced crop yields.
•Sub-scenario 1: Basic scenario plus expanded ecological
protection areas and reduced crop yields.
•Sub-scenario 3: Combination of sub-scenarios 1 and 2.
The results of this exercise show that the availability of biomass 
resources is not only driven by the effect on global food supply but
also by the effect on natural resources, and the need for 
conservation. The assessment of future biomass energy potential is 
only the starting point of a discussion about the integration of
bioenergy into a renewable energy system.
In a next step the surpluses of agricultural areas were classified 
either as arable land or grassland. On grassland, hay and grass 
silage are produced, while on arable land fodder silage and ShortRotation Coppice (such as fast-growing willow or poplar) are 
cultivated. Silage of green fodder and grass are assumed to be used 
for biogas production, wood from SRC and hay from grasslands for 
the production of heat, electricity and synthetic fuels. Country-
specific yield variations were also taken into consideration.
Global biomass potential from energy crops in 2050 falls within a 
range from 6 EJ in Sub-scenario 1 up to 97 EJ in the BAU scenario.
The best example of a country which would see a very different
future under these scenarios in 2050 is Brazil. Under the BAU 
scenario large agricultural areas would be released by 
deforestation, whereas in the Basic and Sub 1 scenarios this would 
be forbidden, and no agricultural areas would be available for 
energy crops. By contrast a high potential would be available under 
Sub-scenario 2 as a consequence of reduced meat consumption.
Because of their high populations and relatively small agricultural
areas, no surplus land is available for energy crop production in 
Central America, Asia and Africa. The EU, North America and 
Australia, however, have relatively stable potentials.
The total global biomass potential (energy crops and residues) 
therefore ranges in 2020 from 66 EJ (Sub-scenario 1) up to 110 
EJ (Sub-scenario 2) and in 2050 from 94 EJ (Sub-scenario 1) to 
184 EJ (BAU scenario). These numbers are conservative and 
include a level of uncertainty, especially for 2050. The reasons for 
this uncertainty are the potential effects of climate change on 
agriculture and forests, possible changes in the worldwide political
and economic situation, a higher yield as a result of changed 
agricultural techniques and/or faster development in plant breeding.

have found a solution at a far lower cost than predicted.”
U.S. “CLIMATE CZARINA” CAROL BROWNER 
This chapter summarizes the projections for population growth,
economic growth, and the costs of various energy sources between 
now and 2050. These underlying assumptions are critical to the 
soundness of the overall scenario.
population development projections
An important underlying factor in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario 
is future population development. Population growth affects the size 
and composition of energy demand, directly and through its impact
on economic growth and development. World Energy Outlook 2007 
(WEO) uses the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
projections for population development. For this study, the most
recent population projections from UNDP up to 2050 are applied.33 
Table 3.1 summarizes this study’s assumptions. The world’s 
population is expected to grow by 0.77 % on average over the 
period 2005 to 2050, from 6.5 billion people in 2005 to more than 
9.1 billion in 2050. Population growth will slow over the projection 
period, from 1.2% during 2005-2010 to 0.4% during 2040- 2050.
However, the updated projections show an increase in population of
almost 300 million compared to the previous edition. This will
further increase the demand for energy. The population of the 
developing regions will continue to grow most rapidly. The Transition 
Economies will face a continuous decline, followed after a short
while by the OECD Pacific countries. OECD Europe and OECD 
North America are expected to maintain their population, with a 
peak in around 2020/2030 and a slight decline afterwards. The 
share of the population living in today’s Non-OECD countries will
increase from the current 82% to 86% in 2050. China’s 
contribution to world population will drop from 20% today to 15% 
in 2050. Africa will remain the region with the highest growth rate,
leading to a share of 21% of world population in 2050. Satisfying 
the energy needs of a growing population in the developing regions 
of the world in an environmentally friendly manner is a key 
challenge for achieving a global sustainable energy supply.
economic growth projections
Economic growth is a key driver for energy demand. Since 1971,
each 1 percent increase in global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
has been accompanied by a 0.6 percent increase in primary energy 
consumption. The decoupling of energy demand and GDP growth is 
therefore a prerequisite for reducing demand in the future. Most
global energy and economic models constructed in the past have 
relied on market exchange rates to place countries in a common 
currency for estimation and calibration. This approach has been the 
subject of considerable discussion in recent years, and the alternative 
of purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates has been proposed. Purchasing power parities compare the costs in different
currencies of a fixed basket of traded and non-traded goods and 
services and yield a widely-based measure of the standard of living.
This is important in analyzing the main drivers of energy demand or 
for comparing energy intensities among countries.
Although PPP assessments are still relatively imprecise compared 
to statistics based on national income, product trade and national
price indexes, they are considered to provide a better basis for global
scenario development.34 Thus all data on economic development in 
WEO 2007 refers to purchasing power adjusted GDP. However, as 
WEO 2007 only covers the time period up to 2030, the projections 
for 2030-2050 are based on our own estimates.
GDP growth in all regions is expected to slow gradually over the 
coming decades. World GDP is assumed to grow on average by 3.6 
percent per year over the period 2005-2030, compared to 3.3 
percent from 1971 to 2002, and on average by 3.3 percent per 
year over the entire modeling period. China and India are expected 
to grow faster than other regions, followed by developing countries 
in Asia, Africa and the other Transition Economies. The Chinese 
economy will slow as it becomes more mature, but will nonetheless 
become the largest in the world in PPP terms early in the 2020s.
GDP in OECD Europe and OECD Pacific is assumed to grow by 
around 2% per year over the projection period, while economic 
growth in OECD North America is expected to be slightly higher.
The OECD share of global PPP-adjusted GDP will decrease from 
55% in 2005 to 29% in 2050.
fossil fuel and biomass price projections
The recent dramatic fluctuations in global oil prices has resulted in 
rising forward price projections for fossil fuels. Under the 2004 
‘high oil and gas price’ scenario from the European Commission, for 
example, oil was projected to cost just $34 per barrel in 2030.
More recent projections of oil prices in 2030 range from the IEA’s 
$60 per barrel (in 2005 dollars) in WEO 2007 up to $115 per 
barrel in the ‘high price’ scenario of the US Energy Information 
Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2008.

Since the last Energy [R]evolution report was published, however,
the price of oil has moved over $100/bbl for the first time (at the 
end of 2007), and in July 2008 reached a record high of more than 
$140/bbl. Although oil prices have fallen since then, the above 
projections might still be considered too conservative considering 
long-term global trends in reserves and demand. Considering the 
growing global demand for oil and gas the Energy [R]evolution 
projects a price development path for fossil fuels in which the price 
of oil reaches $120/bbl by 2030 and $140/bbl in 2050.
As the supply of natural gas is limited by the availability of pipeline 
infrastructure, there is no world market price for natural gas. In 
most regions of the world the gas price is directly tied to the price 
of oil. Gas prices are assumed to increase to $20-25/GJ by 2050.
cost of CO 2emissions
Assuming that a global CO 2emissions trading system is established,
the cost of long-term CO 2allowances will need to be included in the 
calculation of electricity generation costs. Projections of emissions 
costs are even more uncertain than energy prices, and available 
studies span a broad range of future CO 2cost estimates. As in the 
previous Energy [R]evolution study we assume CO 2costs of
$10/tCO 2in 2010, rising to $50/tCO 2in 2050. Additional CO 2costs 
are applied to developing countries that are signatories to the Kyoto 
Protocol after 2020 (see table 3.2).power plant investment costs
fossil fuel technologies and carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
Although fossil fuel power technologies in use today for coal, gas,
lignite and oil are at an advanced stage of market development,
further cost reduction potentials are possible. The potential for cost
reductions is limited, however, and will be achieved mainly through an 
increase in efficiency, or a reduction in investment costs.35 
There is much speculation about the potential for carbon capture 
and storage (CCS) technology to mitigate the effect of fossil fuel
consumption on climate change, even though the technology is still
under development.
CCS is a means of trapping CO 2from fossil fuels, either before or 
after they are burned, and ‘storing’ (as a means of disposal) it in 
the sea or beneath the surface of the Earth. There are currently 
three different methods of capturing CO 2: ‘pre-combustion,’
‘postcombustion,’ and ‘oxyfuel combustion.’ However, development is 
at a very early stage, and commercial-scale CCS will not be 
implemented—in the best case—before 2020 and will probably not
become commercially viable as an effective mitigation option until
2030 or later. Indeed there is no guarantee at this stage that CCS 
will ever be made to work on a commercial scale.

22 GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
Cost estimates for CCS vary considerably, depending on factors 
such as power station configuration, technology, fuel costs, project
size and location. One thing is certain, however: CCS is expensive.
CCS requires significant funds to construct the power stations and 
the necessary infrastructure to transport and store carbon. The 
IPCC cost estimates range from $15 to $75 per ton of captured 
CO 236 while a recent U.S. Department of Energy report found 
installing carbon capture systems to most modern plants resulted in 
a near doubling of costs.37 These costs are estimated to increase the 
price of electricity in a range from 21-91 percent.
Pipeline networks will also need to be constructed to move CO 2to 
storage sites. This is likely to require a considerable outlay of
capital.38 Costs will vary depending on a number of factors,
including pipeline length, diameter, manufacture from corrosion-
resistant steel, and the volume of CO 2to be transported. Pipelines 
built through or near population centers or on difficult terrain, such 
as marshy or rocky ground, are more expensive.39 
The IPCC estimates a cost range for pipelines of $1-8/ton of CO 2
transported. A U.S. Congressional Research Service report
calculated capital costs for an 11-mile pipeline in the Midwest at
approximately $6 million. The same report estimates that a 
dedicated interstate pipeline network in North Carolina would cost
upwards of $5 billion due to the limited geological sequestration 
potential in that part of the country.40 Storage and subsequent
monitoring and verification costs are estimated by the IPCC to 
range from $0.5-8/tCO 2injected and $0.1-0.3/tCO 2injected,
respectively. The overall cost of CCS could therefore serve as a 
major barrier to its deployment.41 For the above reasons, CCS power plants are not included in the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario’s financial analysis. Table 3.3 
summarizes our assumptions on the technical and economic 
parameters of future fossil-fuelled power plant technologies. In 
spite of growing raw material prices, we assume that further 
technical innovation will result in a moderate reduction of future 
investment costs as well as improved power plant efficiencies. These 
improvements are, however, outweighed by the expected increase in 
fossil fuel prices, resulting in a significant rise in electricity 
generation costs.3projections of future energy demand and cost|COSTS OF CO 2EMISSIONS

23 cost projections for renewable energy technologies
The range of renewable energy technologies available today display 
marked differences in terms of their technical maturity, costs and 
development potential. For example, hydro power has been widely 
used for decades, but other technologies, such as the gasification of
biomass, have yet to find their way to market maturity. Some 
renewable sources, including wind and solar power, by their very 
nature provide a variable supply, requiring a revised coordination 
with the grid network. But although in many cases these are 
‘distributed’ technologies—their output being generated and used 
locally—the future will also see large-scale applications in the form 
of offshore wind parks, photovoltaic power plants and concentrating 
solar power stations.
By using the individual advantages of different renewable technologies,
and linking them with each other, a wide spectrum of available options 
can be developed to market maturity and gradually integrated into 
existing energy supply structures. This will eventually provide a 
complementary portfolio of environmentally friendly technologies for 
heat and power supply and the provision of transport fuels.
Many of the renewable technologies employed today are at a 
relatively early stage of market development. As a result, the costs 
of electricity, heat and fuel production are generally higher than 
those of competing conventional systems although external
(environmental and social) costs of conventional power production 
are not included in market prices. It is expected, however, that
compared with conventional technologies large cost reductions can 
be achieved through technical advances, manufacturing 
improvements and large-scale production. For example, when 
examining long-term scenarios spanning several decades, the 
dynamic trend of cost developments clearly identifies economically 
sensible expansion strategies.To identify long-term cost developments, learning curves have been 
applied which reflect the correlation between cumulative production 
volumes of a particular technology and a reduction in its costs. For 
many technologies, the learning factor (or progress ratio) falls in the 
range between 0.75 for less mature systems to 0.95 and higher for well-
established technologies. A learning factor of 0.9 means that costs are 
expected to fall by 10% every time the cumulative output from the 
technology doubles. Empirical data shows, for example, that the learning 
factor for PV solar modules has been fairly constant at 0.8 over 30 
years while that for wind energy varies from 0.75 in the UK to 0.94 in 
the more advanced German market. Assumptions on future costs for 
renewable electricity technologies in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario 
are derived from a review of learning curve studies,42 for example by 
Lena Neij and others, from the analysis of recent technology foresight
and road mapping studies, including the European Commission funded 
NEEDS (New Energy Externalities Developments for Sustainability) 43 
project or the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives 2008, and a 
discussion with experts from the renewable energy industry.3projections of future energy demand and cost|COST PROJECTIONS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES

24 GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
photovoltaics (pv)
The worldwide photovoltaics (PV) market has been growing at over 35 
percent per year and the contribution it can make to electricity 
generation is starting to become significant. Development work is 
focused on improving existing modules and system components by 
increasing their energy efficiency and reducing material usage.
Technologies like PV thin film (using alternative semiconductor 
materials) or dye sensitive solar cells are developing quickly and present
a huge potential for cost reduction. The mature technology crystalline 
silicon, with a proven lifetime of 30 years, is continually increasing its 
cell and module efficiency (by 0.5 percent annually), whereas the cell
thickness is rapidly decreasing (from 230 to 180 microns over the last
five years). Commercial module efficiency varies from 14 to 21 percent
depending on silicon quality and fabrication process.
The learning factor for PV modules has been fairly constant over 
the last 30 years; with a cost reduction of 20 percent each time the 
installed capacity doubles, indicating a high rate of technical
learning. Assuming a global installed PV capacity of 1,600 GW 
between 2030 and 2040 and electricity output of 2,600 TWh, we 
can expect generation costs of around 5-10 cents/kWh (depending 
on the region). During the following five to ten years, PV will
become competitive with retail electricity prices in many parts of
the world and competitive with fossil fuel costs by 2050. The 
importance of photovoltaics comes from the decentralized/centralized 
character of the technology, its flexibility for use in an urban 
environment, and huge potential for cost reduction.concentrating solar power (csp)
Solar thermal ‘concentrating’ power stations (CSP) can only use 
direct sunlight and are therefore dependent on high irradiation 
locations. North Africa, for example, has a technical potential
which far exceeds local demand. The various solar thermal
technologies (parabolic trough, power towers and parabolic dish 
concentrators) offer good prospects for further development and 
cost reductions. Because of their more simple design, ‘Fresnel’
collectors are considered as an option for additional cost reduction.
The efficiency of central receiver systems can be increased by 
producing compressed air at a temperature of up to 1,000°C, which 
is then used to run a combined gas and steam turbine.
Thermal storage systems are a key component for reducing CSP 
electricity generation costs. The Spanish Andasol 1 plant, for 
example, is equipped with molten salt storage with a capacity of
7.5 hours. A higher level of full load operation can be realized by 
using a thermal storage system and a large collector field. Although 
this leads to higher investment costs, it reduces the cost of
electricity generation. Significantly, this storage technology can 
allow CSP plants to function as baseload energy, producing power 
24 hours a day even when the sun is not shining.
Depending on the level of irradiation and mode of operation, it is 
possible to achieve long-term future electricity generation costs of
6-10 cents/kWh. This presupposes rapid market introduction in the 
next few years.3projections of future energy demand and cost|RENEWABLE ENERGY COSTS

25 wind power
Within a short period of time, the development of wind power has 
resulted in the establishment of a flourishing global market. The 
world’s largest wind turbines, several of which have been installed 
in Germany, have a capacity of 6 MW. While favorable policy 
incentives have made Europe the main driver for the global wind 
market, in 2007 more than half of the annual market was outside 
Europe. This trend is likely to continue. The boom in demand for 
wind power technology has nonetheless led to supply constraints. 
As a consequence, the cost of new systems has stagnated or even 
increased. Because of the continuous expansion of production 
capacities, the industry expects to resolve the bottlenecks in the 
supply chain over the next few years. Taking into account market
development projections, learning curve analysis, and industry 
expectations, we project that investment costs for wind turbines will
reduce by 30 percent for onshore and 50 percent for offshore 
installations by 2050.biomass
The crucial factor for the economics of biomass utilization is the 
cost of the feedstock, which today ranges from a negative cost for 
waste wood (based on credit for waste disposal costs avoided) to 
expensive energy crops. The resulting spectrum of energy generation 
costs is correspondingly broad.
One of the most economical options is the use of waste wood in 
steam turbine combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Gasification 
of solid biomass, on the other hand, which opens up a wide range of
applications, is still relatively expensive. In the long term it is 
expected that favorable electricity production costs will be achieved 
by using wood gas both in micro CHP units (engines and fuel cells) 
and in gas-and-steam power plants. Great potential for the 
utilization of solid biomass also exists for heat generation in both 
small and large heating centers linked to local heating networks.
Converting crops into ethanol and ‘bio diesel’ made from rapeseed 
methyl ester (RME) has become increasingly important in the U.S.,
as well as Brazil and Europe. Processes for obtaining synthetic 
fuels from biogenic synthesis gases will also play a larger role.
A large potential for exploiting modern technologies exists in Latin 
and North America, Europe and the Transition Economies, either in 
stationary appliances or the transport sector. In the long term,
Europe and the Transition Economies will realize 20-50 percent of
the potential for biomass from energy crops, while biomass use in all
the other regions will have to rely on forest residues, industrial wood 
waste and straw. In Latin America, North America and Africa in 
particular, an increasing residue potential will be available.
In other regions, such as the Middle East and all Asian regions, the 
additional use of biomass is restricted, either due to a generally low 
availability or already high traditional use. For the latter, using

A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
geothermal
Geothermal energy (energy generated from the Earth’s natural
heat) has long been used for supplying heat and since the beginning 
of the last century for electricity generation as well. Geothermally 
generated electricity was previously limited to sites with specific 
geological conditions, but further intensive research and 
development work has enabled the potential areas to be widened. 
In particular, the creation of large underground heat exchange 
surfaces (Enhanced Geothermal Systems - EGS) and the 
improvement of low temperature power conversion, for example 
with the Organic Rankine Cycle, open up the possibility of
producing geothermal electricity anywhere. Advanced heat and 
power cogeneration plants will also improve the economics of
geothermal electricity.
As a large part of the costs for a geothermal power plant come 
from deep underground drilling, further development of innovative 
drilling technology is expected. Assuming a global average market
growth for geothermal power capacity of 9 percent per year up to 
2020, adjusting to 4 percent beyond 2030, the result would be a 
cost reduction potential of 50 percent by 2050:
•for conventional geothermal power, costs of from 7 cents/kWh 
will drop to about 2 cents/kWh.
•for EGS, despite the presently high figures (about 20 cents/kWh),
electricity production costs - depending on the payments for heat
supply - are expected to come down to around 5 cents/kWh in the 
long term.
Because of its non-fluctuating supply and continuous feed to the 
electricity grid, geothermal energy is considered to be a key element
in a future energy supply structure based on renewable sources.
Until now we have just used a marginal part of the geothermal
heating and cooling potential. Shallow geothermal drilling makes 
possible the delivery of heating and cooling at anytime, anywhere,
and can be used for thermal energy storage.ocean energy
Ocean energy, particularly offshore wave energy, is a significant
resource, and has the potential to satisfy an important percentage 
of electricity supply worldwide. Globally, the potential of ocean 
energy has been estimated at around 90,000 TWh/year. The most
significant advantages are the vast availability and high 
predictability of the resource and a technology with very low visual
impact and no CO 2emissions. Many different concepts and devices 
have been developed, including taking energy from the tides, waves,
currents and both thermal and saline gradient resources. Many of
these concepts are in an advanced phase of research and 
development, and large scale prototypes have been deployed in real
ocean conditions.
The cost of energy from initial tidal and wave energy farms has been 
estimated to be in the range of 15-55 cents/kWh, and for initial tidal
stream farms in the range of 11-22 cents/kWh. Generation costs of
10-25 cents/kWh are expected by 2020. Key areas for development
will include concept design, optimization of the device configuration,
reduction of capital costs by exploring the use of alternative 
structural materials, economies of scale and learning from operation.
According to the latest research findings, the learning factor is 
estimated to be 10-15 percent for offshore wave and 5-10 percent
for tidal stream. In the medium term, ocean energy has the potential
to become one of the most competitive and cost effective forms of
generation. In the next few years a dynamic market penetration is 
expected, following a similar curve to wind energy.
Because of the early development stage any future cost estimates 
for ocean energy systems are uncertain, and no learning curve data 
is available. Present cost estimates are based on analysis from the 
European NEEDS project.44

27 hydro power
Hydro power is a mature technology, yet there is still great
potential to exploit new schemes (especially small-scale run-of-river 
projects with little or no reservoir impoundment) and to improve 
and re-power existing sites. The significance of hydro power is also 
likely to be encouraged by the increasing need for flood control and 
maintenance of water supply during dry periods. The future is in 
sustainable hydro power that integrates power plants with river 
ecosystems while reconciling ecology with economically attractive 
power generation.

summary of renewable energy cost development
Figure 3.1 summarizes the cost trends for renewable energy 
technologies as derived from the respective learning curves. It
should be emphasized that the expected cost reduction is basically 
not a function of time, but of cumulative capacity, so dynamic 
market development is required. Most technologies will be able to 
reduce their specific investment costs between 30 percent and 70 
percent of current levels by 2020, and between 20 percent and 60 
percent once they have achieved full development after 2040.
Reduced investment costs for renewable energy technologies lead 
directly to a reduction of heat and electricity generation costs, as 
shown in Figure 3.2. Generation costs today are around 10-25 
cents/kWh for the most important technologies, with the exception 
of photovoltaics. In the long term, costs are expected to converge at
around 5-12 cents/kWh). These estimates depend on site-specific 
conditions such as the local wind regime or solar irradiation, the 
availability of biomass at reasonable prices or the credit granted for 
heat supply in the case of combined heat and power generation.

28 GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
4key results of the u.s. energy [r]evolution scenario
“each day brings further evidence that the ways
we use energy strengthen our adversaries and 
threaten our planet.”
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA 
©R.KASPRZAK/DREAMSTIME
The development of future U.S. energy demand will be determined 
by three key factors:
•Population development: the number of people consuming energy 
or using energy services.
•Economic development, for which Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) is the most commonly used indicator. In general, an 
increase in GDP triggers an increase in energy demand.
•Energy intensity: how much energy is required to produce 
a unit of GDP.
Both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios are based 
on the same projections of population and economic development.
The future development of energy intensity, however, is different,
and only the Energy [R]evolution Scenario takes into account
measures to increase energy efficiency.
projection of energy intensity
An increase in economic activity and a growing population does not
necessarily have to result in an equivalent increase in energy 
demand. There is still a large potential for exploiting energy 
efficiency measures. Under the Reference Scenario, energy intensity 
will be reduced by 1.25 percent on average per year, leading to a 
reduction in final energy demand per unit of GDP of about 56 
percent between 2005 and 2050. Under the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario, it is assumed that active policy and technical support for 
energy efficiency measures will lead to an even higher reduction in 
energy intensity of almost 73 percent.figure 4.1: USA: projection of average energy intensity

29 4key results of the u.s. energy [r]evolution scenario|ENERGY DEMAND BY SECTOR 
energy demand by sector
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario combines population projections,
GDP growth, and energy intensity to propose a new pathway for 
U.S. energy demand. These are shown in Figure 4.2 for both the 
Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference 
Scenario, total primary energy demand increases by more than 40 
percent from the current 96,826 PJ/a to 138,186 PJ/a in 2050. In 
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, primary energy demand decreases 
by 24 percent compared to current consumption and is expected to 
reach 63,294 PJ/a by 2050 
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is 
expected to decrease in the industry sector, but to grow in the 
transport as well as in the residential and service sectors (see 4.3).
Total electricity demand will rise to 5,408 TWh/a in the year 2050.
Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the 
generation of about 2,244 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demand 
can be achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient
electronic devices using the best available technology in all demand sectors. For example, employment of solar architecture in both 
residential and commercial buildings will help to curb the growing 
demand for active air-conditioning.
Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, demand for heat supply will grow up 
to 2030, but after that can be reduced to below the 2015 level (see 
4.4). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent
to 6,963 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. As a 
result of energy-related renovation of the existing residential
buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards for 
new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services 
will be accompanied by much lower future energy demand.
In the transport sector, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario forecasts 
that energy demand will decrease by 50 percent to 13,505 PJ/a by 
2050, saving 66 percent compared to the Reference Scenario. This 
reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient
vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail, and by 
making mobility-related lifestyle changes.

2050 electricity generation 
The development of the electricity supply sector is characterized by 
a dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing 
share of renewable electricity. This growth will compensate for the 
phasing out of nuclear energy and will reduce the number of fossil
fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilization. By 2050, 95 
percent of the electricity produced in the U.S. will come from 
renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables—mainly wind, solar 
thermal energy and PV—will contribute over 85 percent of
electricity generation.
Figure 4.6 shows the comparative evolution of the different
renewable technologies in the U.S. over time. Up to 2020,
hydropower and wind will remain the main contributors to the 
growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind 
will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics 
and solar thermal (CSP) energy.table 4.1: USA: projection of renewable electricity

31 future costs of electricity generation 
Figure 4.7 shows that the up-front investment costs associated with 
the introduction of renewable technologies under the Energy 
[R]evolution Scenario will slightly but temporarily increase the 
price of electricity compared to the Reference Scenario. This 
difference will be less than 0.8 cents/kWh before 2020. Because of
the better energy efficiency, the development of renewable energy 
technologies, and lower CO 2intensity, by 2020 electricity generation 
costs will become economically favorable under the Energy 
[R]evolution Scenario, and by 2050 generation costs will be more 
than 3 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, on the other hand, unchecked growth 
in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO 2
emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today’s 
$352 billion per year to more than $904 billion in 2050. Figure 4.8 
shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario helps stabilize energy 
costs and relieve societal economic pressure.
Long term, costs for electricity supply in the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario are one-third lower than in the Reference Scenario.heat and cooling supply
Today, renewables provide 9.9 percent of U.S energy demand for 
heat supply, the main contribution coming from the use of biomass.
The lack of district heating networks is a severe structural barrier to 
the large-scale utilization of geothermal and solar thermal energy.
Dedicated government support is required to ensure a dynamic 
development. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables 
provide 69 percent of USA’s total heating demand by 2050.
•Energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently growing 
demand for heating and cooling, in spite of improving living standards.
•For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as 
geothermal energy replace fossil fuel systems.
•A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional
applications will lead to a further reduction of CO 2emissions.

transport
A key initiative in the U.S. is to improve the fuel efficiency of the 
cars we drive. In addition, a shift to efficient modes of transport
like rail, light rail and public transportation is important, especially 
in metropolitan areas. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, the car 
fleet still grows by 20 percent from the year 2000 to 2050, and per 
capita miles traveled increase as well with the growth of the 
economy. However, transport sector energy demand is reduced by 
40 percent. Highly efficient propulsion technology, including hybrid,
plug-in hybrid and battery-electric powertrains, will bring large 
efficiency gains. By 2050, 25 percent of U.S. transport energy 
demand will be provided by electricity.primary energy consumption 
Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting 
primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario is shown in Figure 4.11. Compared to the Reference 
Scenario, overall primary energy demand will be reduced by 55 
percent in 2050. Around 75 percent of the remaining demand in 
North America will be covered by renewable energy sources.
development of CO 2emissions
Although U.S. CO 2emissions will increase by 42 percent under the 
Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they 
will decrease from 5,575 MMT in 2005 to 827 MMT in 2050.
Annual per capita emissions will drop from 18.6 tons to 2.1 tons.
In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing 
demand, CO 2emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the 
long run, efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable 
electricity will also reduce CO 2emissions in the transport sector.
With a share of 48 percent of total CO 2, the transport sector will be 
the largest source of emissions in 2050. These figures could be 
further reduced by simple behavioral changes.4key results of the u.s. energy [r]evolution scenario|TRANSPORT, CO 2EMISSIONS, PRIMARY ENERGY CONSUMPTION

33 4key results of the u.s. energy [r]evolution scenario|INVESTMENT IN NEW POWER PLANTS investment in new power plants
The overall level of investment required for new power plants 
before 2030 will cost as much as $1.7 to 2.7 trillion. Aging power 
plants will be the main driver for investment in new energy 
generation capacity in the U.S.
Utilities will make their technology choices within the next five to 
ten years based on national energy policies, in particular market
liberalization, renewable energy and CO 2reduction targets. A 
possible future emissions trading scheme will have an important
influence on whether the majority of investment goes into fossil fuel
power plants or renewable energy and co-generation. The 
investment volume required to realize the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario is $2.8 trillion, approximately $1.1 trillion higher than in 
the Reference Scenario, which will require $1.7 trillion.
While over 60 percent of investment under the Reference Scenario 
will go into fossil fuels and nuclear power plants, at about 
$1 trillion up to 2030, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario shifts 
about 70 percent of investment towards renewable energy. The fossil
fuel share of power sector investment is focused mainly on 
combined heat and power, and efficient gas-fired power plants.
The average annual investment required in the power sector under the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario between 2005 and 2030 is 
approximately $111 billion. Most investment in new renewable power 
generation will go towards wind power, followed by solar photovoltaics.

Concentrated solar power systems, on the other hand, can only be 
operated in U.S. states with more than 2000 hours of direct
sunlight. The main investment in this technology will therefore take 
place in California, Arizona and New Mexico.
The main development of the wind industry will take place 
especially in coastal areas, but also areas further inland such as 
Texas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas. Offshore wind technology will
take a larger share from around 2015 onwards. The main offshore 
wind development will take place around the Atlantic coast. Bio 
energy power plants will be distributed across the U.S., as there is 
potential almost everywhere for biomass and/or biogas 
(cogeneration) power plants.
fossil fuel power generation investment
Under the Reference Scenario, the primary market expansion of
new fossil fuel power plants will be gas-fired power plants, followed 
by coal power plants. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, the 
overall investment in fossil fuel power plants up to 2030 will be 
$468 billion, a figure significantly lower than the Reference 
Scenario’s $823 billion.renewable power generation investment
Under the Reference Scenario, investment in renewable electricity 
generation will be $491 billion. This compares to $1,956 billion in the 
Energy [R]evolution Scenario. How investment is divided between the 
different renewable power generation technologies depends on their 
level of technical development and regionally available resources.
Technologies such as wind power, which in many regions is already 
cost competitive with existing power plants, will take a larger 
investment volume and a bigger market share. The market volume 
attributed to different technologies also depends on local resources 
and policy frameworks within the U.S. states. Figure 4.15 provides 
an overview of the investment required for each technology.
For solar photovoltaic, the primary market will remain in southern 
states and sunny states like California for years to come, but should 
soon expand to other U.S. states. Because solar photovoltaic energy is 
a highly modular and decentralized technology that can be used almost
anywhere, its market will eventually spread across the entire U.S. Solar 
photovoltaic is expected to reach grid parity (generation costs on the 
same level as consumer electricity prices) by 2012 to 2015. GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

On the other hand, because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the 
total fuel cost savings in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is nearly 
$2.1 trillion, or $84 billion per year. These renewable energy 
sources will produce electricity without any further fuel costs 
beyond 2030, while the costs for coal and gas will continue to 
burden the U.S. economy.
Bottom line, the additional fuel costs required by the Reference 
Scenario are almost double the additional investment required by 
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.fuel cost savings with renewables
The total cost for fossil fuels in the Reference Scenario between 
2005 and 2030 amounts to $10.85 trillion, compared to $8.7 
trillion in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario with fuel costs 
decreasing as renewable energy takes up a larger share of the 
energy mix. This means that fuel costs in the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario are 20 percent lower by 2030 than the Reference 
Scenario and 50 percent lower by 2050.
Although the investment costs of gas-fired power stations and 
cogeneration plants remains relatively high in both Scenarios, total
investment in coal-fired power plants in the Energy [R]evolution 
Scenario is 75 percent less than the Reference Scenario. In fact,
the additional costs for coal fuel from today until the year 2030 
would be as high as $2.3 trillion under the Reference Scenario. This 
savings alone would cover the entire investment in renewable and 
cogeneration capacity required to implement the Energy 
[R]evolution Scenario.

A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
36 energy [r]evolution means reducing poverty46
Energy is central to reducing poverty and providing major benefits 
in the areas of health, literacy and equity. More than a quarter of
the world’s population has no access to modern energy services. In 
Sub-Saharan Africa, 80 percent of people have no electricity 
supply. For cooking and heating, they depend almost exclusively on 
burning biomass—wood, charcoal and dung.
Poor people spend up to a third of their income on energy, mostly 
to cook food. Women in particular devote a considerable amount of
time to collecting, processing and using traditional fuel for cooking.
In India, two to seven hours each day can be devoted to the 
collection of cooking fuel. This is time that could be spent on child 
care, education or income generation. In addition, the World Health 
Organization estimates that 2.5 million women and young children 
in developing countries die prematurely each year from breathing 
fumes from indoor biomass stoves.
The Millennium Development Goal of halving global poverty by 
2015 will not be reached without adequate energy to increase 
production, income, education, and create jobs. Halving hunger will
not come about without energy for more productive growing,
harvesting, processing and marketing of food.
Improving health and reducing death rates will not happen without
energy for the refrigeration needed at clinics, hospitals and 
vaccination campaigns. The world’s greatest child killer, acute 
respiratory infection, will not be tackled without dealing with 
smoke from cooking fires in the home. Children will not study at
night without light in their homes. Clean water will not be pumped 
or treated without energy.
The UN Commission on Sustainable Development argues that “to 
implement the goal accepted by the international community of
halving the proportion of people living on less than $1 per day by 
2015, access to affordable energy services is a prerequisite.” greenpeace proposal: feed-in tariff support mechanism 
This chapter outlines a Greenpeace proposal for a feed-in tariff
system (also known in the U.S. as a “clean energy payment
system”) in developing countries. The additional costs of the 
program would be financed by a combination of new sectoral
emissions trading mechanisms and direct finance from technology 
funds to be developed in the Copenhagen climate deal.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario demonstrates that renewable 
electricity generation can have considerable environmental and 
economic benefits. However, developing countries generally lack the 
resources required to transition to a clean energy economy while 
meeting the most basic energy needs of their populations. To bridge 
this investment and cost gap between conventional fossil fuel-based 
power generation and renewables, a support mechanism is needed.
Greenpeace International conceived a support mechanism for 
developing countries—the Feed-in Tariff Support Mechanism 
(FTSM) 45 —to provide financial support from developed nations.
A feed-in tariff incentivizes the production of renewable energy by 
setting a guaranteed, premium price for renewable energy. The 
premium pricing provides investors with a guaranteed return while 
defraying the up-front investment costs associated with building 
new clean energy infrastructure. The value of the feed-in tariff can 
be adjusted for different sources of energy so that less mature 
industries that require additional subsidies can receive additional
support, while more advanced technologies do not.
Several European nations have enacted feed-in tariffs with great
success. In Europe, the feed-in tariff is usually financed through a very 
small additional fee on ratepayer’s energy bills. However, the extra 
costs associated with the program remain an obstacle for developing 
nations, and an alternative funding source would be needed.
The FSTM would be created as what’s known as a “sectoral no-
lose mechanism.” Such a program allows developing countries to 
pledge to set sector-specific emission targets and issue tradable 
emission credits. However, if the country fails to meet its emission 
target, there is no penalty—hence the term “no-lose.” 
Signatories to the Kyoto Protocol are currently negotiating the 
second phase of their agreement, covering the period from 2013-
2017. The FTSM could be built around new sectoral no-lose targets 
for developing countries during these negotiations. Proceeds from 
the sale of emission units under a sectoral no-lose target
mechanism in developing countries could be used to fund the 
additional costs of the FTSM in that country. For some countries a 
directly funded FTSM may be more appropriate than funding 
through sectoral no-lose targets.

37 feed-in tariffs: proven effective clean energy policy
Since the early development of renewable energy, there has been an 
ongoing debate about the best and most effective type of support
scheme. The European Commission published a survey in December 
2005 which provides a good overview of the experience so far.
According to this report, feed-in tariffs are by far the most efficient
and successful mechanism. Globally more than 40 countries have 
adopted some version of the feed-in tariff mechanism.
Although the specific form of these tariffs differs from country to 
country, there are certain clear criteria which are essential. For 
example, a bankable support scheme for renewable energy projects 
that can provide long-term stability and certainty for both investors 
and equipment suppliers is essential.47 Bankable support schemes 
result in lower cost projects, for example, because they lower the 
risk for both investors and equipment suppliers. The cost of wind-
powered electricity in Germany is up to 40 percent less than in the 
United Kingdom 48 , for example, because Germany’s support scheme 
is more stable and reliable.
The four main elements for successful renewable energy support
schemes are:
1.Clear, bankable pricing system.
2.Priority access to the grid with clear identification of who’s 
responsible for what in terms of interconnection and transition,
and how it is incentivized.
3.Clear, simple administrative and planning permission procedures.
4.Public acceptance and support.
For developing countries, feed-in tariffs have the potential to meet all
of these imperatives and therefore are an excellent mechanism for 
investing in clean energy. The main argument against feed-in tariffs is 
the short-term cost. This is a particular challenge for developing 
countries, where many cannot afford costly electricity services.
However, with international support, this obstacle can be overcome.
bridging the gap with international financing
Finance for renewable energy projects is one of the main obstacles 
in developing countries. While large-scale projects have fewer 
funding problems, small, community-based projects, while having a 
high degree of public acceptance, face financing difficulties. The 
experiences from micro-credits for small hydro projects in 
Bangladesh, for example, as well as wind farms in Denmark and 
Germany, show how strong local participation and acceptance can 
be achieved. The main reasons for this are the economic benefits 
flowing to the local community and careful project planning based 
on good local knowledge and understanding. When the community 
identifies the project rather than the project identifying the 
community, the result is generally faster bottom-up growth of the 
renewables sector.
FTSM aims to facilitate the implementation of feed-in tariff laws in 
developing countries by providing additional financial resources to a 
scale appropriate to the circumstances of each developing country.
For countries with higher levels of renewable energy capacity, the creation of a new sectoral no-lose mechanism can generate saleable 
emission reduction units, the proceeds from which can be used to 
offset any additional costs associated with the feed-in tariff system.
In other countries, direct funding may be a more appropriate 
approach to assisting developing countries with the additional costs 
to consumers of the feed-in tariff system.
Funding could come through the connection of the FTSM to the 
international emission trading system via a new no-lose sectoral
trading mechanism to be developed in the Copenhagen Agreement.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario shows that the average 
additional costs (under the proposed energy mix) between 2008 
and 2015 are between 1 and 4 cents per kilowatt-hour, so the cost
per ton of CO 2avoided would be between $13 and $50, indicating 
that emission reduction units generated under a no-lose mechanism 
designed to support FTSM would be competitive in the post-2012 
carbon market.
All renewable energy projects must have a clear set of
environmental criteria which are part of the national licensing 
procedure in the country where the project will generate electricity.
Those criteria will have to meet a minimum environmental standard 
defined by an independent monitoring group. If there are already 
acceptable criteria developed, for example for CDM projects, they 
should be adopted rather than reinventing the wheel. The board 
members will come from NGOs, energy and finance experts as well
as members of the governments involved. The fund will not be able 
to use the money for speculative investments. It can only provide 
soft loans for FTSM projects.
Key parameters for feed-in tariffs under FTSM:
•Tariffs must be variable for different renewable energy 
technologies, depending on their costs and technology maturity,
paid for 20 years.
•Payments must be based on actual generation in order to achieve 
properly maintained renewable energy projects with high 
performance ratios.
•Any additional costs for renewable generation will be paid by 
calculating the wholesale electricity price plus a fixed premium.
To implement FTSM, a developing country must:
•Establish regulations to guarantee access to the electricity grid 
for renewable electricity projects.
•Establish feed-in tariff laws and regulations based on 
successful examples.
•Establish regulations to ensure transparency when establishing 
the feed-in tariff, including full records of generated electricity.
•Set clear regulations for the renewable energy sector, including 
licensing procedures.

Key parameters for the FTSM fund:
•The FTSM fund will guarantee payment of the total feed-in 
tariffs over a period of 20 years if the renewable energy project 
is operated properly.
•The FTSM fund will receive annual income from emissions trading 
or from direct funding.
•The FTSM fund will pay feed-in tariffs annually on the basis 
of generated electricity.
•Every FTSM-funded project must have a professional maintenance 
company to ensure high performance.
•Grid operators must monitor and report energy generation data to 
the FTSM fund for comparison with data submitted by renewable 
energy projects.GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

39 While every country and U.S. state must craft effective climate 
and energy policies specific to their own resources and needs, 
this chapter provides a general overview of the key imperatives 
that public policies must achieve and obstacles the government
intervention is needed to overcome.
towards an efficient global energy market
Policies and measures to promote energy efficiency exist in many 
countries. Energy and information labels, mandatory minimum energy 
performance standards, and voluntary efficiency agreements are the 
most popular efficiency measures. While effective government policies 
usually contain two elements, those that push the markets (such as 
standards) and pull the market (incentives), efficiency standards have 
proven to be an effective, low-cost way to coordinate a transition to 
more energy efficiency. For example, Japan has an energy efficiency 
program that sets mandatory targets subject to ongoing revision and 
provides incentives to manufacturers and importers of energy-
consuming equipment to continuously improve the energy efficiency of
products within selected market segments. 
To maximize the potential for efficiency gains, energy efficiency 
policies must:
support innovation in energy efficiency, low-carbon transport 
systems, and renewable energy production Innovation will play an 
important role in making the Energy [R]evolution more attractive and 
is needed to realize ambitious, ever-improving efficiency and emissions 
standards. Programs supporting renewable energy and energy 
efficiency development and diffusion are a traditional focus of energy 
and environmental policies because energy innovations face barriers all
along the energy-supply chain (from research and development, to 
demonstration projects, to widespread deployment).
set stringent and ever-improving efficiency and emissions 
standards for appliances, buildings and vehicles In the 
residential sector in industrialized countries, standby power 
consumption ranges from 20 to 60 watts per household, equivalent
to 4 to 10 percent of total residential energy consumption. Yet the 
technology is available to reduce standby power to 1 watt and a 
global standard, as proposed by the IEA, could mandate this 
reduction. Japan, South Korea and the state of California have 
already adopted energy standby standards.
develop and implement market transformation policies that 
overcome current barriers and other market failures to reduce 
energy demand In addition to setting and implementing efficiency 
standards, market transformation policies promote the manufacture 
and purchase of energy-efficient products and services. The goal of
this strategy is to create lasting structural and behavioral changes in 
the marketplace, resulting in increased adoption of energy-efficient
technologies. A key element is to overcome market barriers that
inhibit the manufacture and purchase of energy-efficient products.no fuel, no emissions, no problems: renewable energy
At a time when governments around the world are in the process of
liberalizing their electricity markets, the increasing competitiveness of
renewable energy should lead to higher demand. Without political
support, however, renewable energy remains at a disadvantage,
marginalized by distortions in the world’s electricity markets created 
by decades of massive financial, political and structural support to 
conventional technologies. Developing renewables will therefore 
require strong political and economic efforts. 
At present, renewable energy generators have to compete with old 
nuclear and fossil fuel power plants that produce electricity at
marginal costs because consumers and taxpayers subsidize their 
operation. Political action is needed to overcome these distortions 
and create a level playing field.
In fact, renewable energy technologies would already be 
competitive if they received the same research and development
funding and subsidies as fossil fuels and nuclear power, research and 
development and if external costs were reflected in energy prices.
Removing public subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear and applying 
the ‘polluter pays’ principle to energy markets would go a long way 
towards leveling the playing field and would drastically reduce the 
need for government support of renewable energy. Until these 
disparities are corrected, renewable energy technologies will need 
additional support measures from policymakers in order to compete 
with conventional fuels.
Support mechanisms for different energy sectors and technologies 
can vary according to regional characteristics, priorities and initial
policy goals. But some general principles apply to any kind of
support mechanism. These criteria are:
effectiveness in reaching the targets Experience shows that it is 
possible with the right support mechanisms to reach agreed upon,
national renewable energy targets. Any national system should 
focus on the effective deployment of new renewable energy projects 
to increase the percentage of installed capacity and meet renewable 
energy targets.
long-term stability Policymakers need to make sure that investors 
can rely on the long-term stability of any support scheme. It is 
absolutely crucial to avoid stop-and-go markets with frequent
regulatory changes. Market stability will be created when 
governments implement long-term plans and funding for 
renewable energy projects.6elements of successful clean energy policies

40 Providing subsidies to fully mature and polluting technologies is 
highly unproductive for the energy sector. Removing subsidies from 
conventional electricity would save taxpayer money and 
dramatically reduce the need for renewable energy support.
internalization of the social and environmental costs of 
polluting energy The real cost of energy production by 
conventional energy includes expenses absorbed by society, such as 
health impacts and local and regional environmental degradation -
from mercury pollution to acid rain – as well as the global negative 
impacts from climate change. Hidden costs include the waiving of
nuclear accident insurance that is too expensive for nuclear power 
plant operators. The Price Anderson Act, for instance, limits the 
liability of U.S. nuclear power plants up to $98 million per 
accident, and only $15 million per year per plant. The rest is drawn 
from an industry fund of up to $10 billion, and after that, the 
taxpayer becomes responsible.
Environmental damage should, as a priority, be rectified at source.
Translated into energy generation that would mean that, ideally,
production of energy should not pollute, and it is the energy 
producers’ responsibility to prevent it. If energy producers do 
pollute they should pay an amount equal to the damage the 
production causes to society as a whole. However, the environmental
impacts of electricity generation can be difficult to quantify. How 
do we put a price on Pacific Island homes lost as a result of
melting icecaps or on deteriorating health and human lives? 
An ambitious project, funded by the European Commission— 
ExternE—has tried to quantify the true costs, including the 
environmental costs, of electricity generation. It estimates that the 
cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double and that
from gas would increase by 30 percent if external costs, in the form 
of damage to the environment and health, were taken into account.
If those environmental costs were levied on electricity generation 
according to their impact, many renewable energy sources would 
not need any support. If, at the same time, direct and indirect
subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power were removed, the need 
to support renewable electricity generation would seriously diminish 
or cease to exist. 
As with the other subsidies, external costs must be factored into 
energy pricing if the market is to be truly competitive. This requires 
that governments apply a “polluter pays” system that charges the 
emitters accordingly or applies suitable compensation to non-
emitters. Adoption of polluter pays taxation to electricity sources,
or equivalent compensation to renewable energy sources, 
and exclusion of renewables from environment-related energy 
taxation, is essential to achieve fairer competition in the world’s 
electricity markets.simple and fast administrative procedures Complex licensing 
procedures constitute one of the most difficult obstacles that
renewable energy projects have to face. Policymakers should 
remove administrative barriers at all levels. A user-friendly ‘one-
stop-shop’ system should be introduced that includes a clear 
timetable for project approval.
encouraging local and regional benefits and public acceptance 
The development of renewable technologies can have a significant
impact on local and regional areas, resulting from both installation 
and manufacturing. The public must be involved in order to facilitate 
the acceptance of renewable technologies. Local projects should 
encourage regional development, employment and income generation.
demands for the energy sector
Greenpeace and the renewables industry have a clear agenda for 
changes which need to be made in energy policy to encourage a 
shift to renewable sources. The main demands are:
•Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.
•Internalize the external costs (social and environmental) of energy 
production through ‘cap and trade’ emissions trading.
•Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming 
appliances, buildings and vehicles.
•Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and combined 
heat and power generation.
•Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to the 
grid for renewable power generators.
•Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example 
through feed-in tariff programs.
•Implement better labeling and disclosure mechanisms to provide 
more environmental product information.
•Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy 
and energy efficiency.
removing energy market distortions
The following steps provide a description of what needs to be done to 
eliminate or compensate for current distortions in the energy market.
eliminate subsidies for dirty energy Conventional energy sources 
receive an estimated $250-300billion 49 in subsidies per year 
worldwide, resulting in heavily distorted markets. Subsidies artificially 
reduce the price of power, keep renewable energy out of the market
place and prop up noncompetitive technologies and fuels. Eliminating 
direct and indirect subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power would 
help move towards a level playing field across the energy sector. The 
2001 report of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force argued that
“readdressing them [subsidies] and making even a minor re-direction 
of these considerable financial flows toward renewables, provides an 
opportunity to bring consistency to new public goals and to include 
social and environmental costs in prices.”

41 priority grid access Rules on grid access, transmission and cost
sharing are often inadequate. Legislation must be clear, especially 
concerning cost distribution and transmission fees. Renewable 
energy generators should be guaranteed priority grid access. Where 
necessary, grid extension or reinforcement costs should be borne by 
the grid operators, and shared between all consumers.
support mechanisms for renewables
The following section provides an overview of the existing support
mechanisms and operation experiences. Support mechanisms 
remain a second best solution for correcting market failures in the 
electricity sector. However, introducing them is a practical political
solution to acknowledge that, in the short term, there are no other 
practical ways to apply the “polluter pays” principle.
Overall, there are two types of incentives to promote deployment of
renewable energy. These are Fixed Price Systems, which dictate the 
electricity price (or premium) paid to the producer and lets the 
market determine the quantity, and Renewable Electricity Standards,
which dictate the quantity of renewable electricity and leaves it to the 
market to determine the price. Both systems create a protected 
market against a background of subsidized, depreciated conventional
generators whose external environmental costs are not accounted for.
These policies aim is to provide incentives for technology 
improvements and cost reductions, leading to cheaper renewables 
that can compete with conventional sources in the future.
The main difference between quota-based and price-based systems 
is that the former aims to introduce competition between electricity 
producers. However, competition between technology 
manufacturers, which is the most crucial factor in bringing down 
electricity production costs, is present regardless of whether 
government dictates prices or quantities. Prices paid to wind power 
producers are currently higher in many European quota-based 
systems (UK, Belgium, and Italy) than in fixed price or premium 
systems (Germany, Spain, Denmark).removal of electricity sector barriers Complex licensing 
procedures and bureaucratic hurdles constitute one of the most
difficult obstacles faced by renewable energy projects in many 
countries. Regulatory agencies should set a clear timetable for 
approving renewable energy projects at all levels. In addition, U.S.
regulators should propose more detailed procedural guidelines to 
strengthen existing legislation and at the same time streamline the 
licensing procedure for renewable energy projects.
A major barrier is the short to medium-term surplus of electricity 
generating capacity in many countries. Due to over-capacity it is 
still cheaper to burn more coal or gas in an existing power plant
than to build, finance and depreciate a new renewable power plant.
Even in those situations where a new technology would be fully 
competitive with new coal or gas fired power plants, the investment
will not be made. Until we reach a situation where electricity prices 
start reflecting the cost of investing in new capacity rather than the 
marginal cost of existing capacity, policy support for renewable 
energy will be required to level the playing field.
Other barriers include the lack of long-term planning at national,
regional and local level; lack of integrated resource planning; lack 
of integrated grid planning and management; lack of predictability 
and stability in the markets; no legal framework for international
bodies of water; grid ownership by vertically integrated companies;
and a lack of long-term research and development funding.
There is also a complete absence of grids for large-scale renewable 
energy sources, such as offshore wind power or concentrating solar 
power (CSP) plants; weak or non-existent grids onshore; little 
recognition of the economic benefits of embedded/distributed 
generation; and discriminatory requirements from utilities for grid 
access that do not reflect the nature of the renewable technology.
The reforms needed to address market barriers to renewables include:
•Streamlined and uniform planning, licensing, and permitting 
procedures and a system to integrate cost-efficiency into energy 
network planning.
•Access to the grid at fair, transparent prices and the removal of
discriminatory access and transmission tariffs.
•Fair and transparent pricing for power throughout an energy 
network, with recognition and remuneration for the benefits of
embedded generation.
•Unbundling of utilities into separate generation and 
distribution companies.
•Grid management authority must carry the costs of grid 
infrastructure development and reinforcement, rather than 
individual renewable energy projects.
•Disclosure of fuel mix and environmental impact to end users 
to enable consumers to make informed choices regarding 
power sources.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
42 The downside is that investors can bid an uneconomically low 
price in order to win the contract and then not build the project.
Under the UK’s NFFO (Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation) tender 
system, for example, many contracts remained unused. The system 
was eventually abandoned. If properly designed, however, with 
long contracts, a clear link to planning consent and a possible 
minimum price, tendering for large scale projects could be 
effective, as it has been for offshore oil and gas extraction in 
Europe’s North Sea.
•Tradable green certificate (TGC) systems operate by offering 
“green certificates” for every kWh generated by a renewable 
producer. The value of these certificates, which can be traded on a 
market, is then added to the value of the basic electricity. A green 
certificate system usually operates in combination with a rising 
quota of renewable electricity generation. Power companies are 
bound by law to purchase an increasing proportion of renewables 
input. Countries that have adopted this system include the UK,
Sweden, Italy and many individual states in the U.S., where the 
system is known as a Renewable Electricity Standard.
Compared with a fixed tender price, the TGC model is more risky 
for the investor, because the price fluctuates on a daily basis,
unless effective markets for long-term certificate (and electricity) 
contracts are developed. Such markets do not currently exist. The 
system is also more complex than other payment mechanisms.
Which one out of this range of incentive systems works best? 
Based on past experience it is clear that policies based on fixed 
tariffs and premiums can be designed to work effectively.
However, introducing them is not a guarantee for success. Almost
all countries with experience in renewable energy support policies 
have, at some point in time, used feed-in tariffs, but not all have 
contributed to an increase in renewable electricity production. It
is detailed policy design, in combination with other measures,
which determine success.
renewables for heating and cooling
Largely forgotten, but equally important is the heating and cooling 
sector. In many regions of the world, such as Europe, nearly half of
the total energy demand is for heating/cooling, a demand which can 
be addressed easily at competitive prices.
Policies should make sure that specific targets and appropriate 
measures for renewable heating and cooling are part of any 
national renewables strategy. These should foresee a coherent set of
measures dedicated to the promotion of renewables for heating and 
cooling, including financial incentives, awareness raising campaigns,
training of installers, architects and heating engineers, and 
demonstration projects. For new buildings, and those undergoing 
major renovation, there should be an obligation to use a minimum 
share of renewable energy for heat consumption.
Policy measures should stimulate the deployment of cost-effective 
renewable heating and cooling, available already with today’s 
technologies. At the same time, increased research and development
efforts should be undertaken, particularly in the fields of heat
storage and renewable cooling.fixed price systems Fixed price systems include investment subsidies,
fixed feed-in tariffs, fixed premium systems and tax credits.
•Investment subsidies are capital payments usually made on the 
basis of the rated power (in kW) of the generator. It is generally 
acknowledged, however, that systems which base the amount of
support on generator size rather than electricity output can lead 
to less efficient technology development. There is therefore a 
global trend away from these payments, although they can be 
effective when combined with other incentives.
•Fixed feed-in tariffs (FITs), widely adopted in Europe, have proved 
extremely successful in expanding wind energy in Germany, Spain 
and Denmark. Operators are paid a fixed price for every kWh of
electricity they feed into the grid. In Germany the price paid varies 
according to the relative maturity of the particular technology and 
reduces each year to reflect falling costs. The additional cost of the 
system is borne by taxpayers or electricity consumers.
The main benefit of a FIT is that it is administratively simple and 
encourages better planning. Although the FIT is not associated 
with a formal Power Purchase Agreement, distribution companies 
are usually obliged to purchase all the production from renewable 
installations. Germany has guaranteed payments for 20 years. The 
main problem associated with a fixed price system is that it does 
not lend itself easily to adjustment – whether up or down - to 
reflect changes in the production costs of renewable technologies.
•Fixed premium systems, sometimes called an “environmental
bonus” mechanism, operate by adding a fixed premium to the 
basic wholesale electricity price. From an investor perspective,
the total price received per kWh is less predictable than under a 
feed-in tariff because it depends on a constantly changing 
electricity price. From a market perspective, however, it is argued 
that a fixed premium is easier to integrate into the overall
electricity market because those involved will be reacting to 
market price signals. Spain is the most prominent country to 
have adopted a fixed premium system.
Tax credits, as operated in the US and Canada, offer a credit
against tax payments for every kWh produced. In the United 
States, the market has been driven by a federal Production Tax 
Credit (PTC) of approximately 1.8 cents per kWh. It is adjusted 
annually for inflation.
renewable quota systems Two types of renewable quota systems 
have been employed: tendering systems and green certificate systems.
•Tendering systems involve competitive bidding for contracts to 
construct and operate a particular project, or a fixed quantity of
renewable capacity in a country or state. Although other factors 
are usually taken into account, the lowest priced bid invariably 
wins. This system has been used to promote wind power in 
Ireland, France, the UK, Denmark and China.

43 Although the economic and environmental benefits of the Energy 
[R]evolution are clear, we will not be able to achieve this clean 
energy future or cut emissions as quickly as necessary to solve 
global warming without strong government support worldwide.
Unfortunately, the historical track record in the U.S. is one of
overwhelming support for fossil fuels and nuclear power at the 
expense of renewables and energy efficiency.
This chapter provides very brief summary of energy and climate 
policy at the state and local level in the U.S.
u.s. federal energy and climate policies
At the national level, U.S. energy policy has long favored fossil
fuels and expanding energy production rather than improving energy 
efficiency and renewables. For example, between 1948 and 1998,
the federal government spent $111.5 billion on energy research and 
development programs. Of this amount, 60 percent, or $66 billion,
was dedicated to nuclear energy research, and 23 percent, or $26 
billion, was directed to fossil fuel energy research.50 
Oil companies and other mining interests have for decades been 
allowed to pay royalties at a far below market rate when they mine 
or drill on public lands. Under the Bush administration, additional
previously protected public lands were opened to still more drilling,
while environmental standards were weakened, and a moratorium 
banning new off-shore drilling was allowed to expire. Efforts to 
increase royalties for drilling and mining on public lands were 
blocked in 2008, but the issue may be revisited in the future.
Further, the Obama administration is expected to reverse at least
some Bush-era policies allowing drilling and mining on public lands 
and off U.S. coastlines.
Historically, the overwhelming share (currently about 80 percent) 
of tax dollars spent on transportation has gone towards the 
construction of roads and highways, not public transit. In 2009,
Congress is slated to reauthorize the nation’s transportation policy 
and has an opportunity to redirect more resources towards public 
transit, though it remains to be seen whether the political will for 
such a shift exists.
The nuclear industry has arguably been more heavily subsidized 
than any other source of energy. The Price-Anderson Act alone,
which caps the nuclear industry’s liability in the event of a nuclear 
accident, represents a subsidy of almost immeasurable value. If
forced to buy private insurance on the free market in the absence of
this liability shield, the nuclear industry couldn’t exist.
In recent years, the number of proposed nuclear plants has 
increased considerably, including with 23 new applications for 
construction and operating licenses between 2004 and late 2008.
However, only four of these included actual plant designs, and allproposed plants are dependent on federal loan guarantees. Federal
funds appropriated to date could support only two of the proposed 
23 nuclear power plants.
In an effort to extend the life of the coal industry into a carbon-
regulated future, the coal industry has successfully lobbied for generous 
public funding for thus far fruitless efforts to burn coal without
emitting high levels of carbon dioxide (known as carbon capture and 
sequestration, or CCS). In 2008, the Department of Energy’s budget
request raised funding for CCS-related programs by 26.4 percent to 
$623.6 billion while at the same time cutting renewable energy and 
efficiency research by 27.1 percent to $146.2 million.51 There are few 
indications that these subsidies will end or be reduced.
Recent developments suggest, however, that the tide may be turning as 
concerns about global warming have become more urgent. In 2007, the 
U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that the federal
EPA has the authority to regulate global warming pollution under the 
Clean Air Act and directed the EPA to review its previous decision not
to regulate emissions from cars. Under the new Administrator Lisa 
Jackson, EPA is expected to determine that global warming pollution 
represents a danger to the public health and welfare, triggering the 
regulation of global warming emissions under existing law.
In November 2008, the Environmental Appeals Board of the EPA 
declined to approve a permit for a new coal plant in Utah. EPA was 
again urged to consider if carbon dioxide is a pollutant under the 
Clean Air Act. President Obama’s administration may now establish 
a requirement that new coal plants meet a standard for “best
available control technology” for CO 2emissions.
Meanwhile, support for renewable energy has been sporadic. As part
of the financial bailout package in October 2008, Congress passed 
long-awaited extensions of the federal Production (PTC) and 
Investment Tax Credits (ITC). The PTC was established by the 
Energy Policy Act of 1992 and first become available in 1994; it
has expired several times and been extended retroactively for only a 
year or two at a time. Again, in 2008, it was extended for one 
additional year (through 2009 for wind projects and for two years 
for geothermal facilities). The ITC, which applies to residential and 
business installations of solar, small wind and geothermal systems,
was extended for eight years. A $2,000 cap on residential ITC was 
removed, and the prohibition on utilities from obtaining the ITC was 
eliminated. A two-year ITC for marine energy technologies was 
created. In addition, the legislation authorized $800 million for 
clean energy bonds for renewable energy generating facilities.7current u.s. climate and energy policy

A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
In 2007, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 
revised a rule requiring “transparency” for grid access. It creates a 
new category of transmission service that recognizes the variable 
nature of use of the grid by some renewable resources, and provides 
renewables with better access to the system. The rule also requires 
that imbalance charges, which reflect differences between the 
scheduled and actual delivery of energy, account for the special
circumstances presented by renewable generators and their limited 
ability to precisely forecast or control generation levels. 
Efforts to mandate targets for renewable energy at the federal level
have been unsuccessful to date, with biofuels the only exception. In 
December 2007, the Renewable Fuels Standard of 2005 was 
amended to require that 36 billion gallons of biofuels be included in 
the U.S. liquid fuel mix by 2022. A certain share of this must come 
from cellulosic ethanol.
Federal gas mileage (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards 
for light trucks and cars were tightened by Congress in 2007 for the 
first time since the 1970s. As a result, automakers must increase 
their fleetwide gas mileage for the U.S. market from the 2007 
combined (cars and light trucks) average of 22.2 miles per gallon 
(mpg) to 35 mpg by 2020. Additionally, the Obama administration 
has the authority and has indicated a willingness to set still higher 
standards. However, U.S. standards remain well below those in 
China, the European Union, Japan, and several other countries.
Finally, momentum is increasing in Congress for adoption of a 
federal cap on global warming emissions. Legislation to enact a 
federal cap-and-trade program failed in the U.S. Senate in 2008;
however, signs of growing support in Congress are clear. In the U.S.
House of Representatives, 152 members signed principles authored 
by new House Energy & Commerce Committee Chair Henry 
Waxman calling for strong legislation that would require emissions 
cuts of 15-20 percent from current levels by 2020 and 80 percent
from 1990 levels by 2050.
state policies
As the federal government has largely dragged its feet over the last
eight years, states in the U.S. have been leading the way to advance 
renewables and energy efficiency. The overwhelming majority of
states have at least some policies in place to promote renewable 
energy or energy efficiency. 
In combination with federal tax credits, state renewable electricity 
standards (RES) are among the most important factors driving the 
growth of renewable energy in the United States. RES laws require 
a specific share of electricity to come from renewable sources or 
that a specific amount of renewable energy capacity is installed by 
a given date. By late 2008, there were mandatory RES laws in 28 
U.S. states plus Washington, DC, and 5 additional states had 
adopted voluntary goals. When fully implemented, state RES laws 
will affect more than 46 percent of national retail electricity sales 
and together will require more than 10 percent of electricity in the 
U.S. come from clean, renewable sources by 2020.A number of states are also considering Renewable Energy Payments 
(REPs, also known as feed-in tariffs) to assist in meeting state-
mandated renewable energy targets. By late 2008, REP legislation 
was introduced in six states and under consideration in at least six 
more. In 2006, California created a renewable energy payment
program for projects of no more than 1.5 megawatts (MW), with a 
250 MW cap. The payment was based on time-of-use generating 
costs and was originally developed for wastewater and water 
treatment facilities. California has since expanded its REP program 
to include all customer types and increased the cap to 480 MW. (See 
below for more on California’s ground-breaking energy policies) 
In addition, 16 states and Washington, DC have Public Benefit
Funds (worth an estimated $6.8 billion by 2017) to advance 
renewables and energy efficiency (as well as low-income 
assistance). Funding is derived from a very small per kWh charge 
on electricity. 
Many U.S. states have also enacted laws that require net-metering 
to allow customers who produce their own renewable electricity to 
feed their excess electricity into the grid. As of November 2008,
net-metering was available in 44 states and Washington, DC.
A number of states have adopted renewable fuels standards (RFS) 
for biofuels. Although most are for ethanol, some require biodiesel
blending. For example, Minnesota has enacted a 20 percent by 2015 
biodiesel mandate; the legislation requires that 5 percent of the 
feedstock come from non-traditional state agricultural resources.
Several states have also begun taking steps to regulate global
warming pollution directly. Fourteen states and the District of
Columbia have adopted tailpipe emissions standards for 
automobiles. The rule, known sometimes as the California clean cars 
standard, requires federal approval under the Clean Air Act,
because the standard exceeds the standard set by federal law (in 
fact, carbon emissions are totally unregulated federally). After 
years of obstruction by the Bush administration, President Obama 
recently directed his EPA Administrator to review the decision to 
reject the waiver, and approval is considered only a matter of time.
Finally, six states have enacted economy-wide caps on global
warming pollution. California was the first, but Hawaii,
Connecticut, and Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington have 
followed suit. Several other states have adopted non-binding 
emissions reductions targets on either a state basis or as part of
regional partnerships.7current u.s. climate and energy policy|STATE POLICIES

highlight: california The state of California has one of the more 
aggressive RES laws, requiring that renewable energy account for 
20 percent of retail sales by 2010 and reach 33 percent by 2020.
The California Solar Initiative, or “Million Solar Roofs Initiative,” 
offers $3.2 billion in incentives over ten years for solar energy 
projects (including solar space heat, solar thermal electric, solar 
thermal process heat, and photovoltaics) to provide 3,000 
megawatts (MW) of solar capacity in the state by the end of 2017.
In 2004, the state set standards requiring carmakers to reduce 
global warming emissions by approximately 30 percent by 2016. In 
2006, the state enacted the Global Warming Solutions Act, which 
cuts global warming emissions statewide to 1990 levels by 2020 
and by 80 percent by 2050. In late 2007, the California legislature 
also enacted the Solar Water Heating and Efficiency Act of 2007,
a 10-year, statewide incentive program to encourage the installation 
of approximately 200,000 solar water heating systems to offset
natural gas usage in homes and businesses throughout the state.
highlight: hawaii In October 2008, Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle 
announced a comprehensive agreement that aims to transition the 
state from its heavy reliance on fossil fuels for transportation and 
electricity generation to local renewable energy sources. The 
agreement includes a requirement that renewable energy provide 40 percent of electricity by 2030; the immediate deployment of
advanced meters and implementation of time-of-use rates; a 
prohibition on the construction of any new coal-fired power plants;
and a commitment from the state’s electric companies to gradually 
retire fossil fuel-fired power plants or convert them to biofuels. In 
addition, as of January 2010, Hawaii will be the first U.S. state to 
require the installation of solar thermal water heaters on all new 
single family homes.
city policies
Several U.S. cities have adopted renewable energy targets and 
enacted policies to achieve global warming pollution reduction 
goals, create new jobs, and improve the quality of life. For example,
in late 2007, Berkeley, California adopted a plan to finance the cost
of solar panels for property owners who agree to repay the 
investment with a 20-year tax assessment on their property. Over 
two decades, the property tax would be the same or less than the 
property owner’s electricity savings. In June of 2008, the city of
San Francisco adopted the largest municipal solar incentive 
program in the United States – a 10-year program to provide $2.5 
million of subsidies annually for solar installations.

definition of sectors
The definition of different sectors is analog to the sectorial break 
down of the IEA World Energy Outlook series.
All definitions below are from the IEA Key World Energy Statistics 
Industry sector: Consumption in the industry sector includes the 
following subsectors (energy used for transport by industry is not
included -> see under “Transport”) 
•Iron and steel industry 
•Chemical industry 
•Non-metallic mineral products e.g. glass, ceramic, cement etc.
•Transport equipment
•Machinery 
•Mining 
•Food and tobacco 
•Paper, pulp and print
•Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper) 
•Construction 
•Textile and Leather Transport sector: The Transport sector includes all fuels from 
transport such as road, railway, aviation, domestic and navigation.
Fuel used for ocean, coastal and inland fishing is included in 
“Other Sectors”.
Other sectors: ‘Other sectors’ covers agriculture, forestry, fishing,
residential, commercial and public services.
Non-energy use: This category covers use of other petroleum 
products such as paraffin waxes, lubricants, bitumen etc.

MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN WIND POWER WILL HELP CHINA OVERCOME ITS RELIANCE ON CLIMATE DESTROYING FOSSIL FUEL POWER AND SOLVE ITS ENERGY SUPPLY PROBLEM.

Greenpeace is a global organization that uses non-violent direct
action to tackle the most crucial threats to our planet’s biodiversity 
and environment. Greenpeace is a non-profit organization, present
in 40 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.
It speaks for 2.8 million supporters worldwide, and inspires many 
millions more to take action every day. To maintain its 
independence, Greenpeace does not accept donations from 
governments or corporations but relies on contributions from 
individual supporters and foundation grants. 
Greenpeace has been campaigning against environmental
degradation since 1971 when a small boat of volunteers and 
journalists sailed into Amchitka, an area west of Alaska, where 
the US Government was conducting underground nuclear tests. 
This tradition of ‘bearing witness’ in a non-violent manner continues 
today, and ships are an important part of all its campaign work.
