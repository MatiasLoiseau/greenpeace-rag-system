Tokyo Harbour, Oi Fisheries pier.

On 15 April 2008 Japan’s whaling ﬂeet ﬁnished its ﬁve-month
voyage to the Southern Ocean and docked in Tokyo Harbour in
the midst of much international criticism. The Japanese
government has consistently claimed the whaling programme,
which has been going on for more than 20 years, is a lawful
activity, and invests a subsidy of more than 500 million yen
(approximately 5 million US dollars) per year from Japanese
tax payers. The Fisheries Ministry which is the responsible
government ofﬁce, the Japan Institute of Cetacean Research
which is the main constituent for the research, and the whaling
vessels’ charter company Kyodo Senpaku claim that this
research is not only legal, but also based ﬁrmly in credible
science. A Greenpeace undercover operation conducted over
four months, shows clearly that there is serious illegality within
the operation.

SUMMARY OF KEY EVIDENCE:

The Greenpeace evidence shows a systematic, large scale operation
on board the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru, to steal whale meat
processed from the Southern Ocean hunt. It is believed the practise
has been taking place for many years. During the course of the
investigation, Greenpeace obtained a box of stolen whale meat as
proof of the fraud.

The box contained 23.5kgs of whale meat. Known as “Unesu” in
Japanese, the meat is preserved in salt, rather than the ofﬁcial
preserving method of freezing. The box obtained by Greenpeace was
one of four boxes, claimed to be “personal baggage” sent to a home
address via an express delivery company by an employee of Kyodo
Senpaku who was a crew member on board the Nisshin Maru during
the 2007/2008 Southern Ocean expedition. The value of this one box
is between 100,000 yen (US$1,000) and 300,000 yen (US$3,000 ).
Further investigation has established that more than 23 crew
members sent at least 93 boxes of “personal baggage” to at least 30
destinations.

6 Greenpeace International Japan’s Stolen Whale Meat Scandal

From the evidence and testimony of this investigation, it appears that
this kind of theft of whale meat, ﬁnanced by tax payers money, has
been taking place over many years as an open secret.

When enquiries were made to the Fisheries Agency of Japan, which
has jurisdiction over whale meat distribution, they claimed only
ofﬁcially sanctioned whale meat is ofﬂoaded from the Nisshin Maru.

Given the scale and organised nature of the illegality uncovered by
Greenpeace, it is not credible for ofﬁcials from Kyodo Senpaku, the
Institute of Cetacean Research and even the Fisheries Agency to
deny knowledge of the fraud.

Greenpeace will ﬁle a complaint with the Tokyo district Public
Prosecutor’s Ofﬁce. In addition to the complaint, Greenpeace
demands the Government of Japan:

1. begin an immediate, full and public investigation of the
evidence and allegations

2. issue no new licences to the whaling ﬂeet operator, Kyodo
Senpaku

3. revoke the Institute of Cetacean Research whaling permit

4. give no further tax subsidies to the Institute of Cetacean
Research.

The remainder of this report gives further details about the
Greenpeace investigation, including photographic and testimonial
evidence of the scale of the stolen whale meat scandal.

Details of the identity of informers and Kyodo Senpaku employees
have been removed from this report, but employee details will be
supplied to the Tokyo district Public Prosecutors Ofﬁce.

Greenpeace International Japan’s Stolen Whale Meat Scandal 7

Background
1. Contact from an informant

Greenpeace was contacted by an informer who used to be involved
in the whaling operation and claimed to have information about the
Japanese government’s “research whaling” programme.
The credibility of the witness was veriﬁed through secondary
interviews supporting his claims and Greenpeace’s own investigation.

There were four allegations:

1. Individuals preserve large quantities of the valuable cuts of
whale meat in salt and take them home. This is an open secret
on board the ship and has been conducted for decades.

2. After ﬂensing, a lot of whale meat is thrown into the sea in
order not to overload the freezing capacity on board the
Nisshin Maru during the whaling operation.

3. In order to achieve the increased quota from the JARPA II
“research” programme, whales were targeted and not hunted
randomly as required under the scientiﬁc regulations.

4. Working conditions on board the Nisshin Maru have become
very bad because of the JARPA II increased quota and the
demand to catch large numbers of whales.

The four-month long Greenpeace investigation focused on the ﬁrst
claim, of large scale theft of whale meat.

2. Testimonies from informants

During the investigation, additional information from one current and
two former employees of Kyodo Senpaku were also provided to
Greenpeace. Greenpeace carefully examined the testimonies
provided by all three informants, which revealed the following:

1. Many of the veteran crewmembers called “production
workers” who engage in the work of ﬂensing whale meat on
deck take whale meat home themselves.

2. This theft has been considered an “accepted practise” for
decades.

3. They take whale meat of particularly high value (for example
the part called “Unesu” that becomes bacon) into their cabins,
and preserve it in salt.

4. When close to arriving at port, they pack boxes with at least
20 kilos of salted whale meat per box.

5. Some people make up as many as 20 to 30 boxes.

6. Other crewmembers and the Japan Institute of Cetacean
Research staff make private orders for whale meat from the
production workers.

7. They send it to their homes and other places, preserved in
salt, via Seino Transportation Company’s express home
delivery service.

8. In addition to the whale meat preserved in salt, whale meat
is distributed on board for clients of Kyodo Senpaku, and for
individuals’ souvenirs, and delivered after arriving in port.

9. There is also whale meat for direct sale to crewmembers.

10. These boxes are unloaded on the ﬁrst day of arrival at port.

Excerpt from interview with one infomer:
The full transcript is available in Appendix 1

Q: About how many of the people on board, do you think (involved in
this theft)?

A: On the Nisshin Maru, if there’s 150 crew, it’s on the order of about
120 or 130, and everyone takes home about 200 or 300 kilos of
whalemeat or bacon. This is meat that doesn’t appear in the
production ﬁgures, you know.

Q: In other words, separate from the formally announced number of
tons of whalemeat?

A: Apart, it’s apart from that. It seems like they’ve been doing this
since a long time ago.

Q: Is this the kind of situation that everyone knows about?

A, Yes. Everyone knows, but it’s not talked about in public. They all do
it with tacit understanding. There are Kyodo Senpaku staff there too,
but it seems that they see and pretend not to see.

Q: On the Nisshin Maru it’s not only Kyodo Senpaku but, for example,
there are people from the Institute for Cetacean Research on board,
too, aren’t there?

A:, Yes. Probably they do know, but they don’t talk about it openly.

3. Nisshin Maru docks at Tokyo Harbour

On the 15th April 2008, the Nisshin Maru docked at Oi
ﬁsheries pier in Tokyo Harbour. In accordance with the
information received, trucks from Seino Transport were
waiting on the wharf to load baggage, and just after 1pm
about twenty crewmembers in orange helmets and blue
workclothes disembarked and lined up in front of the Seino
Transport trucks.

Approximately 90 boxes, apparently “personal-use” baggage, were
ofﬂoaded and waiting crewmembers quickly loaded these boxes into
the Seino transport trucks, in exactly the same manner that had been
witnessed following the ship’s arrival in 2006. The Greenpeace
investigation team followed the Seino Transport truck overland.

Transport company depot

The trucks were followed to the Seino company depot near the Oi
Fsheries pier where investigators examined and veriﬁed names,
addresses and sales voucher details on each box. Many of the boxes
had listed the contents as “cardboard”, but were clearly far too heavy
to contain only cardboard. Some contents were simply claimed to be
“salted stuff.”

The investigation in the depot has established that more than 23 crew
members sent at least 93 boxes to at least 30 destinations.

5. Kyodo Senpaku company employee
register and comparison

Greenpeace also obtained copies of Kyodo Senpaku employee
registers, which listed 267 names, personal details and the
speciﬁc occupation of those working on board the Nisshin
Maru. According to the information from the informants,
“production workers” are experienced staff assigned to whale
ﬂensing work on the deck of the Nisshin Maru. The information
obtained by Greenpeace suggested that men from these areas
were the most likely to be involved in the theft of whale meat
as they had the most access. Thirty nine of the 267 employees
were listed as production workers, including “production
head” and ”production assistant.”

After documenting delivery notes on boxes at the depot, 23 names
and addresses were noted. Of those 23, 12 names and addresses
matched the personal details on the Kyodo Senpaku employee
register. All were listed as “production workers”.

One of the 12 production workers sent boxes to one ex-production
head, one ex-production assistant head and one ex-production
worker who had been named by the informer as being involved in the
same operation while they were employed by Kyodo Senpaku. The
fact that they are still receiving boxes from current employees
suggests they are still involved in the theft of meat. All 47 boxes sent
by the 12 production workers were due to be shipped to Hokkaido,
Aomori, Nagasaki, Akita, Miyagi, and Yamguchi prefectures.

7. Discovery of salt-preserved whale
meat - the evidence is secured

After carefully opening the box, it was found that contrary to
the consignment sheet claims that it contained cardboard, it
contained ten large pieces of whale meat, known as “unesu”
preserved in salt, hidden under overalls and sealed in thick
plastic packaging. Unesu is high value meat, taken from the
lower jaw to belly region and used to make whale bacon.
Demand for this type of meat is much higher than for the red
meat usually sold on the ofﬁcial market. The total weight of the
meat was 23.5 kilos.

In addition to being prime cuts of meat, the salt preserving process,
which can take months and is not the ofﬁcial preserving process on
board, adds to the value. At the market, minke whale bacon sells for
about 20,000 yen per kilo.

The whale meat in the box had not been fully processed into unesu,
therefore the actual market value is unclear, but even taking this into
consideration, it is estimated to have a value of between 5,000 and
15,000 yen (US$50 – US$150) per kilo. Therefore one 23.5 kilo box
would be worth between 110,000 and 350,000 yen (US$1,100 –
US$3,500). If all four boxes contained the same amount of meat, the
crewmember could be making a proﬁt of between 440,000 to
1,400,000 yen (US$4,400 – US$14,000)

testimony

of Japan

“The minke whale and ﬁn whale products sold by this Institute
are a research byproduct of public character, so it has to be
distributed fairly to all levels of society and at the lowest price
possible. From that point of view, we should ensure fair selling
guarantees, and we requested guidance from traders to the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries integrated food
department distribution section and, under guidance of the
Fisheries Agency Far Seas section this Institute will host a
study group concerning trade for everyone involved in
distribution, and is working to more extensively and fairly
disseminate whale meat at a reasonable price to all classes of
citizens. “(Press release from the Institute of Cetacean
Research 31 May 2007)

Before and after the Nisshin Maru returned to Tokyo harbour on 15
April, Greenpeace investigators visited whale meat sellers and
restaurants in various locations including Hakodate, Hiroshima,
Kushiro, Sapporo, Nagasaki, Nagano, Shimonoseki, Kagoshima, and
Tokyo, gathering evidence that traders not only know stolen whale
meat is available from the Nisshin Maru crew, but that many were
expecting supplies of whale meat well in advance of the ofﬁcial
release of meat in June. Transcripts of secret ﬁlming of traders is
contained in Appendix 1.

At the press conference on April 5th 2008, Takahide Naruko, a
chief of Far Seas Fisheries Division of the Fisheries Agency of
Japan, said that raising the price of the whale meat from the
research whaling had been considered. “This is because we
could hunt only 551 whales this year from the Southern Ocean,
60% of our aim, since activities by anti-whaling organizations
disturbed our research.” (April 15th 2008, Asahi-Shinbun
Website)

Greenpeace Japan telephoned Takahide Naruko on May 8th 2008.
Despite the apparent widespread knowledge of the illegal activities on
board the Nisshin Maru factory whaling ship amongst crew, as well as
meat traders who expect to receive the supplies earlier than the
ofﬁcial release date, Mr. Naruko denied that there was any possibility
of crew privately bringing back whale meat from the Southern Ocean
whaling expedition. If it is true that the authorities responsible for
whale meat distribution are not aware of additional meat being sold
earlier than the ofﬁcial release dates, then this raises serious
questions about the competence of the Fisheries Agency and the Far
Seas Fisheries Division, to manage the whaling programme and the
subsequent meat sales.

A full transcipt of the recorded conversation is in Appendix 1.

22 Greenpeace International Japan’s Stolen Whale Meat Scandal

10. Greenpeace Demands:

A full investigation and cancellation
of whaling permits required

In addition to the need for a full public investigation and the
suspension of permits, Greenpeace proposes that subsidies to
the Institute of Cetacean Research and contracts to Kyodo
Senpaku should no longer be issued for a whaling programme,
but the resources and staff of both organisations could be
employed as part of the Australian government's proposed
collaboration on non-lethal research on whales and marine life
in the Southern Ocean.

The demand for whale meat is now so low that the operation is
commercially unsustainable – a fact made clear by the revelation that
the Institute of Cetacean Research has been unable to repay the 1
billion yen (approximately 10 million US dollars) government loan from
2006.

The Japanese taxpayer should no longer be expected to fund a failed
and corrupt whaling programme in the Southern Ocean.

APPENDIX ONE: TRANSCRIPTS OF
TESTIMONY AND INTERVIEWS
GREENPEACE INFORMER

Q: First of all, to start with, it’s ﬁne to say as much or as little as you like,
but could you please let us know how it is that you knew about the
details that you’ve given to us as evidence at this time, and the reason
why you gave it to us now. .

A: It’s because I was actually with Kyodo Senpaku, whaling in the
Southern Ocean, sailing on the research programme. If you ask why I
wanted to talk about it, the reality is that a considerable quantity of
whalemeat was being discarded under the name of research. I had
some doubt about whether this maybe wasn’t research, you know, and
felt that this wasn’t good, and started wanting to talk about it.

Q: In what way speciﬁcally was the discarding of the whalemeat
being done?

A: As there was a period when we couldn’t catch due to Greenpeace
and Sea Shepherd’s obstruction actions, the situation was that we had
to quickly catch in a hurry, and there were many times when we had to
catch at least 20 minke in a day. At those times mostly, when there
were at least twenty whales, it was ‘miscellaneous meat.’ We couldn’t
handle all this smaller parts of meat and other miscellaneous meat and
it would be left there as it was until the next day. At 7.00am, the next
new whale would come on board. Next, we couldn’t ﬁnish processing
and the whole lot would just be discarded. From one minke there is
about 350 kilos of miscellaneous meat, so by a rough calculation it
would seem about seven tons was thrown away.

Q: That means almost on a daily basis about seven tons of meat was
being discarded?

A: That’s right. When twenty or more whales came on board, without a
doubt they discarded meat.

Q: That means, without any processing they discard it just like that?

A: That’s right. Without touching it. They discard it because there’s no
time to process it.

Q: How did the ship’s crew who saw this feel about it?

A: A lot of people were saying don’t catch them if it’s just going to be
discarded, but it wasn’t something that could be complained to the
bosses, you know. It was a private matter. They were saying don’t take
them if it’s so many that they’re discarded.

Q: I expect for the people who caught the whales, the fact that they
were discarded…

A: They really hated that. It was a very disagreeable thing for the people
who have been involved a long time with whales.

24 Greenpeace International Japan’s Stolen Whale Meat Scandal

Q: So what they’re doing is quite pointless?

A: Yes, it’s not research whaling, it seems like it’s commercial whaling.

Q: So they take just the part they need and discard the remainder?

A: Yes, that’s right. It seemed they were working with the idea that
they’ll discard it without touching it.

Q: In some places, it’s been said that the random catching wasn’t being
done. What do you think about that?

A: It seemed like whenever they could catch a whale, they caught it.
Most of the time when they couldn’t, it was when the sea was rough.
The impression is that when whales could be caught, they would catch
any number.

Q: So you deﬁnitely didn’t have the sense that they were catching
randomly, but taking them wherever they were, whenever they were
there.

A: That’s right.

Q: Beside this, do you know of other matters in which the
crewmembers were doing wrongful things?

A: Well, I think this is probably a traditional thing, but most of the crew
preserve whalemeat in salt themselves, such as Unesu for whale
bacon, and take it home. This is a fair quantity, with so many people
taking some. It’s not every crewmember, though. The young people
don’t have much interest. All the people of a certain age are taking it
home.

Q: Speciﬁcally, the older crewmembers are people connected with what
kind of employment?

A: Mostly production, they’re production workers. It’s production
workers mostly.

Q: About how many of the people on board, do you think?

A: On the Nisshin Maru, if there’s 150 crew, it’s on the order of about
120 or 130, and everyone takes home about 200 or 300 kilos of
whalemeat or bacon. This is meat that doesn’t appear in the production
ﬁgures, you know.

Q: In other words, separate from the formally announced number of
tons of whalemeat?

Q: What about the least?

A: They take about ﬁve or six boxes.

A: Apart, it’s apart from that. It seems like they’ve been doing this since
a long time ago.

Q, Is this the kind of situation that everyone knows about?

A: Yes. Everyone knows, but it’s not talked about in public. They all do it
with tacit understanding. There are Kyodo Senpaku staff there too, but
it seems that they see and pretend not to see.

Q: On the Nisshin Maru it’s not only Kyodo Senpaku but, for example,
there are people from the Institute for Cetacean Research on board,
too, aren’t there?

A: Yes. Probably they do know, but they don’t talk about it openly. To
some extent everyone is being fair and square in this way, they aren’t
doing something like stealing in front of people’s eyes. Each person is
doing it in a hidden way. But everybody knows. But they aren’t doing
anything to pursue the matter boldly.

Q: Would there be, for example, whales like ﬁn whales included in that?

A: Yes. When I was on board we were taking ﬁn whales, and ﬁn whale
is perfect, so red meat and unesu from ﬁn whales was included.
However, not entirely. I think most of that was grabbed and packed by
upper management and other superiors.

Q: As for this whalemeat which is hidden and taken home, is a lot of it
high value?

A: High value product, yes. All of it.

Q: So this means they don’t steal the inexpensive cuts?

A: Right. 80% is unesu. The raw material for bacon, you know.

Q: How exactly are they doing this as you say “in a hidden way”?

A: There’s red meat, and fatty red meat, and tail meat too.

Q: Is there anything besides that?

A: For example, if it’s unesu, it’s made into bacon, and each person
pickles it in salt to preserve it in their own cabin. For the rest of the
meat, cuts like red meat and tail meat are preserved by freezing.
Everyone has their own coldstore, and in there is a place for preserving.

Q: So this means they are preserving something taken improperly?

A: That’s right. Yes.

Q: Is this hiding and taking meat home done for no particular reason,
simply to hide it and take it home?

A: If it was just to eat at home, they wouldn’t need that kind of quantity.
Therefore, well, the impression is that people who have been crew for
ten or 20 years are selling it on a wide scale in their home towns and at
markets in the area.

Q: In what kind of form does everyone put it in?

A: They pack it in boxes. Frozen goods are already packed in boxes,
and everything is packed in boxes.

Q: What kind of tangible form does that take, is there evidence for this
selling on a large scale that one hears of, is there anything like that?

A: I heard it from people on the ships’ crew. There was even one who
said he’d sold enough, just with bacon, to build a house.

Q: So they put this there under an implicit understanding?

A: That’s right. It’s known that it exists, and none of the people
responsible say anything. None of the the Kyodo Senpaku employees
say anything. The Institute people almost never go in there,

Q: Do you know what quanity is taken home by the people who take
the most, for example?

A: Yes. The biggest packing case for home delivery service can
generally hold about 40 kilos, and there are people who take about 20
boxes. So that’s 800 kilos. About that much, for people who take the
most.

Q: Earlier, you mentioned that people from the Japan Institute for
Cetacean Research knew about this to some extent, but to what extent
do you think everyone was awarre of it?

A: They weren’t looking to catch people red-handed but knew it was
going on, and mostly said nothing.

WHALE MEAT TRADERS

Case 1: 24 and 26 April Conversation with female trader
said to be delivering salt to Kyodo Senpaku company

24 April 2008

14:14:06

Researcher: Do you have something like a delicious tasting salt,
maybe a good salt to spread over ﬁsh and preserve it? Are there
different kinds?

Woman: No, because even for something like whale, ordinary salt is
used. The preserving of the skin in salt is done with salt coming from
here. Coarse sea salt is good. If it’s a carefully selected part, the type
of salt makes no difference.

14:14:50

Researcher: Where is the whale coming from?

Woman: You hear it a lot, don’t you, like Kyoko Senpaku or Nisshin
Maru. They bring it back pickled in salt, or frozen. The research
whaling has been treated badly recently hasn’t it? They’re coming
back on the 29th. Coming into the Universal shipbuilding dock. We’re
doing that sort of work.

14:16:20

Researcher: Have you been selling salt for a long time?

Woman: Uh-huh, been making a living from shipping for a long time.
It’s that kind of work, isn’t it.

26 April 2008

17:10:00

Researcher:At the sushi shop kindly recommended to me by your
husband I was able to have some of this year’s whale meat.

Woman : But for sushi, it’s no good because the mothership isn’t in
yet, you know. [Go] after it comes in. That’s after it comes on the
29th. Because then that sushi shop [and] people from restaurants
around this area buy it.

Researcher: Oh, they buy it from the ship?

Woman: No, not from the ship but I don’t know what the route is.

17:12:10

Researcher:There’s frozen whale and there’s salt-pickled whale. So is
it that you’re selling your salt to Kyodo Senpaku?

Woman: Uh-huh.

Case 2: 24 April Conversation with male trader said to be
delivering salt to Kyodo Senpaku company

24 April 2008

19:05:40

(After visiting the recommended sushi shop)

Researcher: It wasn’t written on the menu.

Man: Yeah, it’s not.

Researcher: If you’re in the know, you’re in the know?

Man: (Nods)

onwards.

Researcher: If so, I’ll go then. Is it this sort of feeling every year? When
the ship arrives…

Man: Some people have them, somehow…

Case 3: 24 and 26 April Conversation with sushi shop man in
Hiroshima prefecture introduced by man in Case 2

Researcher: Is there enough time?

Man: (makes afﬁmative gesture)

Researcher: Well then, I’ll come again around the end of the month.

26 April 2008

17:32:35

Researcher: Is the meat I’ve asked for today from the Southern
Ocean? Did it come this year?

Man: (makes afﬁrmative motion)

17:34:19

Researcher: Quite valuable, this, isn’t it? Special route… new meat
from the Southern Ocean, I humbly partake. Which part is it from?

Man: That’s a secret. The very best is meat from the tail, but it’s so
much so that it’s practically impossible to get if you don’t live in
Nagatacho.

19:27:15

Researcher: I’ve come today having been referred by Mr. XX. I’d like
to eat whale.

Researcher: Crewmembers take whalemeat for their own use. In
secret?

Man: Yes?

Researcher: Do you have this year’s new stock?

Man: We do have some, but haven’t cut the seal yet.

19:27:30

Researcher: When will you be opening this year’s?

Man: It’s been busy, you know. Ha ha ha.

Researcher: So it’s that you’re in the process of stocking up?

Man: That’s right.

Man: That’s right. Those who have recently joined get red meat, and
it’s allocated by seniority of service. Of course the good parts, well it’s
the same with everything, but there’s a thing called ﬁshermen’s
cuisine.

17:49:00

Man: The delicious parts don’t appear in the market. They choose the
best parts themselves when they do the ﬂensing.

Researcher: What I’ve had just now, has it come by that route?

Man: No, no, that comes a different way.

Researcher: I’m in Hiroshima til the end of the month, will it be in
time?

Researcher: By a different route, there’s a route for obtaining this
year’s meat?

Man: Hmm, well.

Man: (nods)

TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH
FISHERIES AGENCY OFFICIAL

Researcher: The high value part?

8 May 2008

Man: (nods) If you pay a bit of money you can get it. On the boat, it’s
classiﬁed by regions of the country. It’s cut precisely and comes out
as sashimi product.

11:58

18:00:40

Researcher: Are the crew selling what they’ve secretly brought back?

Man: That kind of thing doesn’t happen much. Mostly it’s friends and
relatives and the like. A few years ago there was a crewmember who
said ”I gave some to that snack [bar?]”

Investigator: After the price (of the whale meat) will be decided on
June, will all whale meat be sold at this price?

Mr. Naruko: Yes, United price will be set according to each part of the
meat. Meat will go to the wholesalers with this price.

Investigator: Which means there will be no sales before June?

Mr. Naruko: Yes, without a price, there’s no way to sell.

18:12:30

Researcher: About how much, by weight, of this meat is being
brought in?

Man: (silence)+ Sometimes there’s talk about frozen blocks coming
from Kyushu.
The whalemeat that’s just arrived hasn’t gone round anywhere yet.

Investigator: I heard from somewhere that the sailors used to bring
back some whale meat as private souvenirs during the industrial
whaling period. This does not happen these days under the research
whaling, right?

Mr. Naruko: Of course not. Since the distribution (of whale meat) is
very limited.

18:23:10

Investigator: Since the whale meat is considered as “ofﬁcial,” right?

Researcher: The specially valuable meat I had just now…

Man: Somewhere, there will be some place where that is.

Mr. Naruko: Yes.

18:25:45

Researcher: Is this meat from this year?

Man: (nods yes)
