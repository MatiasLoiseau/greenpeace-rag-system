 It’s also deadly. Pollution coming from the US coal industry kills up 
to 34,000 Americans per year. So, those who make money selling coal must 
market their product vigorously. They lobby Congress, they lobby children, they lobby every American. 
Coal-fired power plants that do not shut down soon should be required to follow 
an ‘all-of-the-above’ approach to pollution control – saving money on the backs of Americans’ health is not excusable. But the cost of smokestack pollution is only part of the nightmare that is coal.
Mountains aren’t cheap, even if the coal industry is 
allowed to treat them that way. They didn’t pay for the hundreds of beautiful Appalachian mountains they’ve obliterated. Mountaintop removal mining has devastated ecosystems in the most biodiverse part of the continental United States and destroyed water sources forever. Transporting coal to feed the furnaces’ unceasing hunger nearly monopolizes the US rail system and requires burning huge amounts of petroleum for highly polluting trucks. 
In 2008 alone, the coal industry managed to get average 
Americans to pick up as much as $500 billion in its costs. Every year, burning coal creates 17 million tons of toxic ash, which leaches heavy metals like mercury into drinking water sources. Costs of mercury emissions from smokestacks alone cost up to $29 billion each year, in the form of lost productivity from illness, mental retarda -
tion, and treatment for cardiovascular disease. 
President Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) proposed to reduce pollution of mercury and other airborne toxics, but some Members of Congress are acting as in-house lobbyists for large polluters like American Electric Power (AEP), Midwest Generation, or Edison International. The two-decade history of this long-developing standard for mercury pollution is a debacle illustrating the undue influence of the coal industry on our elected representatives.

Today Americans suffer under the smokestacks 
of over 600 power plants that burn coal to produce electricity. The average age of these coal plants is 43 years. Some plants were even built near the turn of the century [the last century!] and in many cases have not installed any type of pollution-reduction technology.
The majority of the ancient US coal fleet has not installed easily available technology that could reduce mercury pollution by 90%. Coal combustion is responsible for most US mercury pollution. Mercury contributes to thousands of deaths annually and may adversely affect the development of over 400,000 babies per year. Mercury exposure is a serious problem for the lungs, brain, heart, stomach, kidneys, and immune system. Much airborne mercury often falls back to the ground and waterways within only 100 or so miles, but it can be re-emitted into the air, float down streams, and accumulate in animals since mercury cannot be digested. 
This report provides a sampling of the actions of a bipartisan cadre of 15 politicians, who are among those in the House of Representatives working for America’s dirty and decrepit coal-fired power industry. These 15 members have tried to stop EPA from modernizing standards for pollutants that come predominantly from coal-fired power plants, including mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, greenhouse gases, and coal ash. Except for the one fresh -
man, these members of Congress are in the top 25% of those receiving money from the fossil fuel industry. Many are in leadership positions within Congress. The actions reviewed for these 15 politicians were opposed to the health of people in their own districts. 
*Coal-fired power plants reviewed are bigger than 100 Megawatts, and not 
slated to shut down for 5 years or more.
