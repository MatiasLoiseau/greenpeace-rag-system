LOGGING ROADS TO
CLIMATE RUIN

UP TO 25% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COMES FROM
TROPICAL FOREST CLEARANCE
Up to a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions are almost exclusively linked to tropical
deforestation, often for conversion to pastureland and agricultural plantations. The figure
excludes – because the numbers simply have not been calculated on the global scale –
the emissions from forest fragmentation and degradation resulting from the creation of
logging roads and other industry related infrastructure. The area of forest cleared for
these roads can be wider than some of Europe’s major motorways.

34 BILLION TONNES OF CO2
Predictions for future deforestation in Central Africa estimate that by 2050 forest
clearance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will release up to 34.4 billion
tonnes of CO2, roughly equivalent to the UK’s CO2 emissions over the last sixty years.
The DRC risks losing more than 40% of its forests, with transport infrastructure such
as logging roads being one of the major drivers.

50 MILLION HECTARES OF RAINFORESTS BEING CARVED UP
50 million hectares of rainforests in Central Africa are controlled by logging
companies. That is an area the size of Spain currently being carved up by logging
roads and other infrastructure. 30% (some 15 million hectares) of this is held by
logging companies in the DRC whose logging contracts were signed after a 2002
moratorium on new contracts or the renewal or extension of existing ones.

8% OF GLOBAL CARBON STORES
8% of the earth’s carbon that is stored in living forests worldwide is stored in the forests
of the DRC – that is more than any other country in Africa and makes the DRC the fourth
largest forest carbon reservoir of any country in the world.

CLEARANCE FOR LOGGING INFRASTRUCTURE CAUSES 2.5 TIMES
MORE EMISSIONS THAN SELECTIVE LOGGING ITSELF
Greenpeace’s calculations, based on analysis of one 170,000 hectare logged area, suggest
that emissions from logging roads and infrastructure will be 2.5 times greater than
emissions resulting from the selective logging itself. The emissions for the area are
estimated at an average of 10 tonnes of CO2 per hectare.

WHAT A CARVE UP
– KEY FACTS ABOUT DRC
RAINFOREST DESTRUCTION
AND KEY QUESTIONS FOR
THE WORLD BANK

PUTTING IT ALL IN PERSPECTIVE
Climate change caused by atmospheric build-
up of greenhouse gases is the greatest threat
the world faces today. Global emissions from
tropical deforestation alone contribute up to
25% of total annual human-induced CO2
emissions to the atmosphere.

Predictions for future deforestation in Central
Africa estimate that by 2050 forest clearance
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) will release a total of up to 34.4 billion
tonnes of CO2, roughly equivalent to the UK’s
CO2 emissions over the last sixty years. The
DRC risks losing more than 40% of its forests,
with transport infrastructure such as logging
roads being one of the major drivers.

Logging roads open up the rainforest allowing
access. With access comes commercial
poaching: the rainforests are being emptied of
large mammals to feed the trade in commercial
bushmeat and ivory. And once the rainforest is
opened up by logging roads, the area becomes
vulnerable to clearance for agriculture. With
road clearance come CO2 emissions from
rainforest destruction. With CO2 emissions
comes further climate instability.

Logging titles across Central Africa already
cover some 50 million hectares of rainforest,
an area the size of Spain. Logging companies
are effectively road engineers, laying down a
skeletal grid of arterial routes through intact
rainforests. The swathes cleared through the
forest for these logging roads can be wider
than some of Europe’s major motorways.

Extensive logging roads and other logging
infrastructure are a significant source of
emissions through fragmenting and
degrading rainforests. As global emissions
figures only take account of deforestation,
the emissions resulting from such
fragmentation are currently overlooked.

‘Urgent intervention against

Experts recommends that

Democratic Republic of the

Congo, particularly the

regulations governing natural

resources and their orderly

exploitation, be used as a

Council Group of Experts,

2007

More than 20 million hectares of logging titles
are in the DRC, where due to war, the
rainforests has largely escaped destruction
until now. This rainforest is now at risk of being
carved up into logging concessions for
companies to gain access to a handful of
valuable timber species.

The recent return of peace in the DRC and the
new Government provide a unique opportunity
for the international community to support
genuine development in one of the world’s
poorest countries and to take critical action to
protect the global climate.

The World Bank’s support for development
through extractive industries, including logging,
is set to compromise the future of the DRC’s
rainforests, its people, and the global climate.

WHAT’S AT STAKE?
The Congo rainforests of Central Africa are of
global importance. They form the second
largest rainforest block on earth after the
Amazon rainforest, covering more than 172
million hectares. The Congo rainforests are
critical to the survival of our closest animal
relatives: the bonobo, the chimpanzee and the
gorilla. Yet only 8.5% of the remaining areas of
intact rainforests in Central Africa enjoy
‘protected’ status.

Rainforests represent important carbon
reserves, and their preservation is critical to
maintaining the balance of the global climate.
Two-thirds of the Congo’s remaining intact
rainforests lie within the DRC. The DRC alone
accounts for 8% of that part of the earth’s
carbon which is stored in living forests. This is
more than any other country in Africa, and is
the fourth highest national store of forest
carbon in the world. More than a quarter of the
country is still covered with large areas of intact
rainforest, covering some 60 million hectares.

The Congo Basin also has a significant
influence over the regional climate.
Representing the third largest region of deep
convection on earth after the Western Pacific
and Amazonia, the Congo Basin affects rainfall
patterns over the North Atlantic.

The DRC’s rainforests are critical for its
inhabitants. Of the more than 60 million
people in the DRC, about 40 million depend

upon the rainforests to provide essential food,
medicine, and other non-timber products,
along with energy and building materials.

WHAT IMPACT HAS THE
WORLD BANK HAD IN THE DRC?
The World Bank suspended financial assistance
to the DRC in the 1990s, as war broke out
over control of natural resources. ‘Corrupt
and criminal elites’, backed by foreign
multinationals, joined in a free-for-all to gain
control of natural resources. While timber
production was at a virtual standstill because
of the war, about 43.5 million hectares of
forest – an area larger than California and
twice the size of the United Kingdom – came
under the control of the logging industry.

The World Bank resumed lending to the DRC
in 2001. It is now by far the largest funder of
reconstruction in the country. This puts it in
unique position to influence the country’s
development, for good or bad. By August
2006, the World Bank Group had approved
loans, credits and grants to the DRC worth
more than $4 billion.

HAS IT BROUGHT THE LOGGING
INDUSTRY UNDER CONTROL AND
SLOWED ITS EXPANSION?
In May 2002, the World Bank convinced the
transitional DRC government to suspend the
allocation of new logging titles and the renewal
or extension of existing ones. This moratorium
followed a World Bank-instigated tax review of
logging contracts: 163 non-compliant
contracts covering 25.5 million hectares of
rainforest were cancelled. Most were ‘dormant’
– that is, in areas not being logged.

In its online Questions & Answers the World
Bank celebrates the ‘cancellation of non-compliant
concessions [sic]’ as ‘an unprecedented move
anywhere in the world’, critical to ‘slow[ing]
the expansion of logging’ and ‘free[ing] up
space for potential new protected areas in the
rainforest part of the country.’

While few new forest areas have been
protected since the 2002 moratorium, by
April 2006 members of the transitional DRC
government had signed 107 new contracts
with logging companies covering more than
15 million hectares of forest. These include
contracts approved under the guise of

remapping, exchange, adjustments and
relocations of old titles, as well as out-and-
out new allocations.

moratorium it negotiated with the transitional
DRC government and other forestry sector
reforms have been enforced.

In a context of corruption and poor governance
in the DRC, the World Bank’s attempts to
reform the forestry sector are currently failing
to control the expansion of logging.

The World Bank’s latest attempt to control the
expansion of the logging industry is a so-called
legal review of titles. 156 logging contracts
covering 21 million hectares of rainforest are
currently being assessed against compliance
with some basic legal criteria.

Greenpeace has investigated the actions
of most of the major logging companies
whose contracts have been submitted to the
legal review. Our findings expose serious
lapses of governance, a massive lack of
institutional capacity to control the forestry
sector, widespread illegalities and social
conflicts, as well as clashes with established
conservation initiatives. As this report
reveals, foreign companies including Danzer
group (Siforco), ITB, the NST group (CFT,
Forabola, Sodefor, Soforma), Olam, Sicobois
and Trans-M have all had new contracts
signed after the May 2002 moratorium. The
majority have therefore benefited from the
World Bank’s failure to ensure that the

Greenpeace fears that the legal review could
become an exercise in laundering illegal
contracts. Do the World Bank and the DRC
Government have the political will to crack
down on those who have benefited from
such corruption?

A review of the 156 contracts under
review – Greenpeace’s key findings:
107 out of 156 contracts were signed after
the May 2002 moratorium. Only 40 of those
signed prior to the moratorium appear to have
paid their area tax in 2004 (tax payment being
a criterion of the legal review, 2004 is the only
year for which government data, however
inaccurate, is publicly available).

Nearly half of the 156 titles are in intact forest
landscapes – critical for carbon storage and
very significant for wildlife protection.

Because comprehensive maps are not publicly
available, the location of 13 contracts covering
1.7 million hectares (an area the size of
Kuwait) cannot be determined.

All the contracts are in areas inhabited by
forest-dependent communities; two-thirds

overlap areas inhabited by pygmy
hunter-gatherers.

A third of the contracts are inside areas
already identified as priority landscapes for
conservation. Twenty of those contracts are
located wholly or partially within the Congo
Basin Forest Partnership’s Maringa-Lopori-
Wamba landscape, critical bonobo habitat.

A third of the contracts are located in areas
with afrormosia, a protected tree species
whose international trade is supposed to
be strictly regulated (listed under CITES
Appendix II).

Challenges for the Legal Review
Is the contract a straight violation of the
2002 moratorium?

Greenpeace research shows:
s Companies, including Trans-M, seem to

have taken over areas previously occupied
by ‘non-compliant titles’ cancelled in April
2002. Many of these contracts are located
within intact forest landscapes.

The implications of these findings are
serious: such violations would mean that the
cancellation of non-compliant titles in April
2002 did little more than take logging rights
from speculative owners who did not use them,
freeing up space for new logging operations.

Do logging contracts comply with ‘boundaries
as defined by the contract and the
topographical map attached to said contract’?

As Greenpeace research shows:

s Both NST group companies and the Danzer
group (Siforco) – which between them hold
more than 5 million hectares of rainforest
– redefined many of their contracts and
title boundaries after the moratorium was
decreed in 2002 and in advance of the
legal review. Only through detailed
comparison of old and revised maps and
boundaries can it be assessed whether the
revised boundaries include new forest areas
and therefore would be illegal under the

May 2002 moratorium. Yet, such pre- and
post-moratorium maps or contracts are
not publicly available.

s ITB’s current forest holdings in Equateur
Province appear to be located in areas
formerly held by cancelled non-compliant
pre-2002 contracts and are larger then
the forests controlled by ITB before the
moratorium. Final conclusive analysis is
lacking because logging title maps both
pre- and post-moratorium are not
publicly available.

Assessment of the legality of revisions to pre-
moratorium contracts (for instance, where a
company has returned forest area to the State)
should therefore include assessment of the
original contracts and maps as well as revised
documents to ensure there are no irregularities.

Will the legal review overlook issues of
corruption and failures of governance?
Greenpeace research suggests that issues of
corruption require close scrutiny for companies
including CFBC (a company said to have links
with the former rebel leader Jean-Pierre
Bemba), ITB, Trans-M, Danzer group (Siforco),
NST group (Sodefor) and Olam. Issues include:

s Payments to forestry officials;

s Subcontracting (which is illegal, but
companies may use loopholes in the
Forestry Code);

s Historic payment of funds to rebel-held

administrations;

s Titles issued in wartime; and

s Political protection afforded to

certain companies.

Conclusion: the World Bank has so far failed
in its objectives of controlling the
expansion of industrial logging and
improving governance of the sector. In the
absence of enforcement, the moratorium
has been a cover for behind-the-scenes
jostling for valuable forest holdings.

HAS IT RAISED MONEY FOR DEVELOPMENT
AND PROVIDED PUBLIC SERVICES TO FOREST
DWELLING COMMUNITIES?
Central to the World Bank strategy in the
DRC is the concept that by collecting tax
based on the surface area of logging
companies’ forest holdings, the Government
will obtain revenue to drive development,
including improved provision of public
services for rainforest communities.

Where has the money gone?
The World Bank-imposed Forestry Code of
2002 stipulates that 40% of area tax is to be
redistributed to local authorities for
development projects. Not one dollar of the
area tax that has actually been collected
between 2003 and 2006 has been
redistributed to local authorities. Further, there
is gross tax avoidance: a DRC Ministry of
Finance list from 2005 reveals that 45% of the
area tax due from logging companies for the
previous year had not been paid; tax avoidance
through timber smuggling is also a serious
issue – there are estimates that actual timber
export levels are as much as seven times
higher than official figures.

Has logging improved
the life of local communities?
Greenpeace research shows that all 156 titles
up for legal review are in areas inhabited by
forest-dependent communities – and some
two-thirds of these are known to be inhabited
by pygmy hunter-gatherer communities.

The Forestry Code formalises a pre-existing
process whereby a logging company
negotiates directly with communities as to the
services it will provide in exchange for logging
in their area.

Greenpeace’s investigations show that in
exchange for extracting wood worth many
hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies
may give communities gifts worth as little as
$100 in total. Once logging starts, the
provision of services negotiated for by the
community, such as school buildings, is often
either derisory or not delivered at all.

For example:
s Sodefor’s (an NST group company) gift

package often comprises of two sacks of
salt, 18 bars of soap, four packets of
coffee, 24 bottles of beer and two bags of
sugar, in exchange for rainforest access. As
a result the communities effectively sign
away their right to protest against the
company’s activities.

Greenpeace’s investigations show how logging
can impact local community access to vital
forest resources.

For example:
s ITB has a built a log wharf in an important

fish breeding ground.

s Logging companies frequently log

community caterpillar trees. Caterpillars
are a vital source of protein for forest
dependent communities. ITB and Trans-M
are two cases.

6

CARVING UP THE CONGO

Greenpeace has also found that the
negotiation process itself often reinforces
the marginalisation of pygmy hunter-
gatherer communities who are highly
dependent on forest resources.

s In ITB’s operations near Lake Tumba, a
Twa pygmy community was initially
excluded from negotiations over access to
forest. The company then made the
community a take-it-or-leave-it offer to
which the local chief felt he had no option
but to agree.

In addition, Greenpeace has identified a
number of examples of the DRC’s authorities
using violence to repress public dissent where
logging companies have failed to fulfil their
commitments to local communities.

s Protests by local people against CFBC,
Safbois, Sodefor and many other
company operations have been met with
intimidation and arbitrary arrests by local
authorities. Conflicts between villagers
and logging companies are almost
universal, with local authorities often
taking the side of the companies.

Conclusion: the World Bank maintains the
illusion that logging companies will be
largely beneficial to local communities
through their tax revenue and so-called
social responsibility contracts.

HAS IT ACHIEVED RAINFOREST
PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE, WILDLIFE
AND THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT?
Greenpeace research shows that of the 156
titles up for legal review, nearly half are in
intact forest landscapes – the very landscapes
that are most critical for carbon storage for
the sake of the global climate, and of great
significance for the DRC’s rich biodiversity.

While in some cases beyond the remit of the
legal review, many operations are in areas
that have already been identified as priority
conservation landscapes. Logging is going
ahead in these areas prior to any land use
planning to determine how best to conserve
and manage these critical habitats.

s Companies such as Trans-M and the

Danzer group (Siforco) have contracts

for areas inside Maringa-Lopori-Wamba
landscape, now a critical stronghold for
some of the last viable populations of wild
bonobos in the DRC. Bonobo populations
have been decimated by the illegal trade
in bushmeat, and from being hunted as a
source of food during the recent wars.

s Trans-M, whose contracts were signed

after the 2002 moratorium, and Safbois, a
company in conflict with local
communities over its operations, are
logging in an uncontrolled manner large
volumes of afrormosia – a protected tree
species listed under Appendix II of CITES,
meaning that its international trade is
supposed to be regulated.

Greenpeace’s research exposes just what a
threat the selective logging practised across
Central Africa is to biodiversity and the global
environment. Selective logging requires an
extensive road network. The impact of
logging infrastructure on the climate is
significant but does not figure in global
calculations. Given that cross Central Africa,
50 million hectares of rainforest are
controlled by logging companies – an area
the size of Spain – the total impact is likely to
be significant. Forty million hectares are
located in areas of intact forests.

s Using satellite images, Google Earth and
published scientific studies, Greenpeace
has calculated the predicted CO2
emissions from a 170,000 hectare area
of forest formerly logged by the Danzer
group (Siforco). Our calculations show that
logging roads and other infrastructure
(currently not part of international IPCC
calculations on ‘Land Use Change and
Forestry Emissions’) produce a level of
emissions 3.5 times greater than that
from the extraction of the commercial
timber itself (currently the only aspect of
industrial logging operations included in
estimates of the DRC’s emissions).

Conclusion: There is still an opportunity to
protect large areas of intact rainforest, but
action must be taken swiftly. A moratorium
on any new logging title allocation needs to
be enforced until there is comprehensive
national land use planning that prioritises
the needs of the DRC’s people and the
local, regional and global environment.

WHAT FUTURE FOR
THE DRC’S RAINFORESTS?
The legal review is a crunch point for the
World Bank, the DRC Government and the
country’s rainforests. The future of more than
20 million hectares of forest hangs in the
balance. Will the World Bank ensure that the
legal review will not effectively launder illegal
titles and leave corruption unchallenged?
Beyond the legal review, will the World Bank
act in the interests of forest dwelling
communities and the global environment
by adhering to the principles it promotes:
poverty alleviation, good governance and
environmental protection?

The international donor community and the
DRC Government must take steps to crack
down on corruption and stop the plunder:

s Prevent the expansion of industrial logging

They must also help start the solution:

s Initiate land use planning and
overhaul of governance

s Develop viable policies and funding

8

CARVING UP THE CONGO

Fifty million hectares of rainforest is being carved up by logging companies in Central Africa.
Outside the DRC, 71% of the richest rainforest is slated for logging.

‘The faster the nineteenth-

century colonial practice of

logging tropical rainforests

can be eliminated forever, the

better it will be for the people

and wildlife of Central Africa.

… Vast tracts of forest still

remain relatively intact, which

means that it is not too late

to achieve significant
