In light of the disaster still unfolding in the Gulf, Greenpeace is calling on US Department of Interior
Secretary Ken Salazar to stop Shell’s plans to drill for oil off Alaska’s coasts this summer. Putting
the breaks on Shell’s Alaska drilling is a first step toward a comprehensive ban on new oil drilling
in all federal waters. No part of the US coast should be threatened with oil spills, and no coastal
communities should have to bear the economic and social costs that will be felt by Gulf coast
communities for decades to come.

BP DEEPWATER HORIZON

SHELL FRONTIER DISCOVERER

OVERSIGHT:

The US Minerals Management Service did not require
BP to do an analysis of the potential environmental
impacts of the Deepwater Horizon. Oil continues to
pour into the Gulf at a rate of up to millions of gallons
per day.

YEAR BUILT: 2001

RISKS:

BP described the possibility of a spill as “virtually
impossible,” noting that “no mitigation measures other
than those required by regulation and BP policy will
be employed to avoid, diminish or eliminate potential
impacts on environmental resources.”

Because of a Minerals Management Service finding
that a large spill in the Gulf was unlikely, BP was not
required to do a rigorous analysis of the potential
environmental impact of the rig.

SPILL RESPONSE:

BP has attempted to control the spill by spraying
highly toxic chemical dispersants that break up the
oil into small droplets. This highly toxic combination
poses a major threat to marine life and simply hides
the extent of the spill rather than truly “cleaning” it.
BP’s most permanent solution to the massive leak is to
drill additional wells to relieve the pressure. It is hoped
these relief wells can be completed in 6-8 weeks.

Despite multiple failed attempts at other solutions, the
cleanup effort in the Gulf has been largely aided by
calm weather and an abundance of boats and crew
working to contain the oil. In addition, the planning
that’s in place in the Gulf is highly developed, and the
equipment on hand is extensive. For example, 417,320
feet of oil containment boom is available for immediate
use in the Gulf.

OVERSIGHT:
MMS has approved exploration drilling in the Arctic
Ocean without considering the impacts of an accident
like the ongoing BP Gulf disaster or the increased
difficulty of responding in the Arctic. Shell hopes to
begin drilling this summer.

YEAR BUILT: 1966

RISKS:
In its 2010 Exploration Plan for the Chukchi Sea, Shell
states that “a large oil spill, such as a crude oil release
from a blowout, is extremely rare and not considered a
reasonably foreseeable impact.”

 The risk of a blowout like the one that caused the BP
Deepwater Horizon disaster is actually higher in the
Arctic. In fact, the former head of regulatory affairs at
the MMS recently testified that “well control perfor-
mance for deepwater drilling was significantly better
than for shallow water operations.”

SPILL RESPONSE:
Shell also plans to use dispersants in the event of a
spill, with the permanent solution being relief wells.
However, it may be impossible for another rig to arrive
and drill a relief well before the Arctic sea freezes,
which would leave the spill uncontrolled until the
following summer.

The ability to respond quickly or effectively to a spill
in the Arctic is significantly lower than in the Gulf.
Preplanning is woefully inadequate. Maps that detail
the most environmentally vulnerable areas are out of
date. Only 8 self-propelled vessels would be available
to respond to a spill. And as an indication of how
inadequate preparations for a worst-case scenario are,
less than 6,000 feet of containment boom is readily
available.

High and icy seas and stormy weather are typical in
the Arctic. According to NOAA, “recovery rates of
spilled oil in optimum situations (calm weather, in a

In spite of the many resources available for contain-
ment, efforts were brought to a near halt by 8 foot
seas in the days directly following the blowout.

DAMAGE TO ECOSYSTEMS:

The continuous stream of crude oil from BP’s leaking
well threatens hundreds of species in the Gulf of
Mexico, including critical habitat for endangered
species like whales, sea turtles, and migratory birds.
The ecological damage from the BP oil spill could also
extend to the commercial fisheries and shrimp farms
that extend along the Gulf coast. Oyster farms are
particularly sensitive to oil pollution because oysters
are filter feeders, and likely to ingest oil particles as
well as chemical dispersants and oil-soaked plankton.

MONEY SPENT LOBBYING IN 2009:

harbor, rapid response) rarely exceed 20 percent, and
response to spills in ice in remote areas is substantially
more challenging. On-scene response efforts may take
days to weeks to implement, and are rarely effective.”

Cleaning up a major oil spill in the Arctic is impossible.

DAMAGE TO ECOSYSTEMS:
The Arctic waters of Alaska’s Chukchi and Beaufort
seas are home to distinctive Arctic wildlife such as
polar bears, walrus, ice seals and whales, species
already under threat as global warming causes their
sea ice habitat to melt away. Alaska Native communi-
ties have relied on coastal resources for their culture
and subsistence for millenia, putting them at ground
zero if an oil spill takes place.
