Greenpeace’s ancient forest campaign is dedicated to
protecting the world’s remaining ancient forests and theplants, animals and peoples that depend upon them. We investigate and expose the trade in illegal and
destructively logged timber. We support the rights offorest peoples. We challenge governments and industryto end their role in ancient forest destruction. We promote real alternatives such as products certified
by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), which ensuresthat timber comes from environmentally and sociallyresponsible forest management.

1This guide provides practical guidance 
on how to ensure that the paper yourpublishing house uses comes fromenvironmentally and socially responsiblesources. The guide falls into threesections:
•What is the problem? – Unveiling
research by Greenpeace showing thatthe UK book publishing industry issourcing paper from some of the world’slast ancient forests and is unwittinglycontributing to their destruction. 
•What is the solution? – Showcasing
the work of a number of Canadianpublishers that have developed ancientforest friendly paper solutions. 
•What you can do – Providing practical
guidance to ensure that the paper youpurchase comes from environmentallyand socially responsible sources, suchas those independently certified to theForest Stewardship Council (FSC)
standards and/or recycled paper madefrom post-consumer waste.
AT A GLANCE
A staggering 80% of world’s original
ancient forests have been destroyed ordegraded. Today, many countries have losttheir entire original forest cover. Much ofwhat remains is under threat from illegaland destructive logging. Ancient forestsunder threat include forests in Canada,Indonesia, Finland, Russia, Brazil andCentral and West Africa. 
The publishing industry in the UK 
is a major paper user. Research byGreenpeace reveals that a number of thelargest book publishing houses in the UKare unwittingly purchasing paper from atleast two of the world’s ancient forestareas – Finland and Canada. Printing in South East Asia is also common
practice for the book publishing industry.Paper sourcing from the region could becausing rainforest destruction.
Whilst most publishers have environmental
policies in place, these have not beenstrong enough to stop the procurement ofpaper containing fibre from ancient forestdestruction. Now, leading UK authors suchas Charlotte Bingham, Ben Elton, HelenFielding, Anne Fine, John King, AndyMcNab, John O'Farrell, Maggie O'Farrell,Philip Pullman, Ian Rankin, JK Rowling,William Sutcliffe and Penny Vincenzi have
agreed to work with Greenpeace to ensurethat their next books are printed on ancientforest friendly paper. As publishing housesare responsible for procuring book paper,we hope that you will also join us to makesure that the paper you use does notcontribute to ancient forest destruction. 
Greenpeace is calling on the publishing
industry to take action to phase out theuse of paper coming from the destructionof ancient forests and to adoptenvironmentally and socially responsibleprocurement policies. The way to achievethis is to buy paper that contains recycledand/or FSC fibres.
•Buy recycled paper with a high post-
consumer waste content to help takepressure off the world’s ancient forests.
•Buy FSC paper to ensure that the fibre
comes from forests that are wellmanaged to strong ecological and socialcriteria.HOW CAN THIS GUIDE HELP YOU?

2 3WHAT’S AT STAKE?
Ancient forests are forests that have been
shaped largely by natural events and whichare little impacted by human activities.They provide habitat for about two-thirds of
the world’s land-based species of plantsand animals. They are also home tothousands of forest dwelling communities,who depend on them for their survival. Yetevery 2 seconds, an area of ancient forestthe size of a football pitch is destroyed.
Forests purify the air we breathe, prevent
soil erosion, and reduce the risk oflandslides. They preserve watersheds andimprove the quality and quantity offreshwater supplies. They also serve as a
vast carbon reservoir, helping to stabilisethe Earth’s climate.
Today, 80% of the world’s original ancient
forests have been destroyed or degraded.Each year, millions of hectares of ancientforest are logged by the forest industry,driven by the demand for timber productsincluding paper.
HOW IS THE BOOK INDUSTRY
FUELLING ANCIENT FORESTDESTRUCTION?
‘Global production in the pulp, paper and
publishing sector is expected to increaseby 77% from 1995 to 2020.’1
OECD, Environmental Outlook, 2001
In March 2003, Greenpeace wrote to
thirteen publishing houses requestinginformation about the sources of their papersupply.
2The following response typifies the
problem: ‘Papers used are natural,
recyclable products made from woodgrown in sustainable forests.’
Whilst almost
all of the publishing houses claim that theirpaper is from ‘sustainable’ forests, none canback up these claims with credible evidence.In fact, research shows that book publishersare unwittingly fuelling the destruction of theworld’s ancient forests through weak – or insome cases non-existent – environmental
procurement policies.
CURRENT PAPER PROCUREMENT 
BY BO OK PUBL ISHERS
The vast majority of book paper used by
the fiction market is manufactured usingvirgin wood pulp rather than recycledfibre. From the responses received byGreenpeace, it is evident that most ofthis virgin wood pulp is sourced fromScandinavian forests in Finland andNorway. Three companies manufacturemost of this paper: Stora Enso and UPM-Kymmene in Finland, and Norske Skog inNorway. Other mills known to be supplyingthe UK fiction book market are located inSweden, Canada, Estonia, Latvia and Italy.Paper is sourced either directly by thepublisher or indirectly via paper merchantssuch as Paper Management Services. Greenpeace’s findings show that a number
of the largest publishing houses areunwittingly purchasing paper from at leasttwo of the world’s ancient forest areas –Finland and Canada. Some are alsosourcing from Russia (via Finland),where at least 50% of logging isestimated to be illegal. 
A number of publishers have also
confirmed that many children’s books areprinted in Asia, on paper sourced by theirprinters. No information has yet beenprovided regarding countries of origin orevidence of sustainability of the paperssupplied, which could be linked to thedestruction of South East Asia’s rainforests.
Only one of the publishers questioned by
Greenpeace is actively addressing theissue of the environmental impacts of itspaper procurement.
ISN’T PLANTATION TIMBER OK?
Unless plantations have been certified to
FSC standards, there is no guarantee
that they are managed in anenvironmentally and socially responsibleway. In South East Asia, for instance,many plantations have been created byclearing areas of ancient forests, and arethe cause of intense social conflict asindigenous forest dwelling peoples areforced off their lands. While sourcingpaper from European plantations ratherthan from ancient forests is a step in theright direction, they are often managedin an intensive, environmentallydestructive manner. FSC or recycledpaper should therefore be the goal foreverybody.WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?ANCIENT FOREST DESTRUCTION

4 5EUROPE’S LAST ANCIENT FORESTS
‘The effects of forest management are 
the most significant cause of theendangerment of species in Finland.’ 
Finnish Ministry of Environment, 
October 2000
In Europe alone, many countries have
destroyed all their ancient forests. The lastsurviving fragments are found in countriessuch as Finland, Norway, Sweden andEuropean Russia.
3
Finland’s ancient forests account for just5% of the country’s 20 million hectares offorestry land. These fragmented areas ofHigh Conservation Value Forest
4support
hundreds of important species includingthe endangered flying squirrel, the Siberianjay and the three-toed woodpecker, whosenumbers have dramatically declined inrecent years. Many of them are also crucialfor the indigenous Sami people, whodepend on the forests for their traditionallivelihood of reindeer herding. Despite the ecological and cultural
importance of these forests, the Finnishgovernment has only designated half ofthem for protection – just 2.5% of thecountry’s forest area. While the FinnishEnvironment Institute, the University ofHelsinki and even the Finnish Ministry ofEnvironment agree that there is a need forincreased forest protection, thegovernment’s logging arm, Metsähallitus,continues to clear-cut ancient forest areas,in habitats of threatened species and inareas of special cultural value.
In its public literature, Metsähallitus makes
much of the fact that the forests it logsare certified under the Finnish ForestCertification System (FFCS), which it usesto claim some degree of environmentalcredibility. However, FFCS – part of thecontroversial Pan European ForestCertification scheme (PEFC) – has weakstandards and is controlled by industrystakeholders. Research carried out byGreenpeace and the Finnish NatureLeague in 2001 exposed FFCS-certifiedforestry operations logging in ancientforest areas, ignoring the presence of
threatened species and posing a seriousthreat to the economic and cultural survivalof the Sami. The FFCS has no supportfrom any major environmental organisationin Finland.
5
Recent Greenpeace investigations haveconfirmed that timber from unprotectedancient forest areas has continued to enter the supply chain of three Finnishinternational paper manufacturers during2003: Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real. Ancient forest timber is known to
have been used in at least three StoraEnso mills (at Oulu, Kemijärvi andVeitsiluoto), one UPM-Kymmene mill (at
Kajaani) and one M Real mill (at Kemi).
Stora Enso and UPM-Kymmene both
supply book paper to UK publishinghouses. Some publishing houses aresupplied with book paper from UPM-Kymmene’s Kajanni mill, which is known tosource from ancient forest areas.ILLEGAL LOGGING IN 
RUSSIA ’S FORESTS
The problem of forest destruction does not
end at Finland’s borders. Finland is a majorimporter of timber from Russia, purchasingmore than 11 million cubic metres oftimber each year – about 10% of the totalvolume logged in Russia’s forests.
6At least
50% of timber in Russia is logged illegally.7
Both UPM-Kymmene and Stora Enso
source a substantial volume of timberfrom Russia. Whilst some attempts havebeen made to move supply away fromancient forests in Russia, concerns persistregarding illegality and lack of independentcertification of supply. 
CLEAR-CUTTING CANADA’S 
ANCIENT FORESTS
‘The world’s boreal forest, a resource 
of which Canada is the major trustee, is under siege.’ 
Report of the Canadian Senate
Subcommittee on the Boreal Forest, 1999
At least one UK book publisher continues
to source from Canada’s ancient borealforests. These forests contain a uniquemixture of coniferous and broad-leaf treesincluding jack pine, balsam fir, birch andpoplar. The region is home to woodlandcaribou, wolf, beaver, moose and blackbear, and a diversity of birds. 
Canada’s boreal forests are being clear-
cut, largely driven by the demand forconsumer products including paper. Everyyear, the logging industry is cutting downover 400,000 hectares of forest in theprovince of Quebec and over 220,000hectares in the province of Ontario.
Already, the Labrador marten andwolverine are endangered, the woodlandcaribou is threatened and the eastern wolfis deemed vulnerable.
8
Many of Canada’s indigenous peoples arebadly affected by logging in the borealforest. One such community is the GrassyNarrows First Nation. They have beenblockading various logging roads into theCanadian Whiskey Jack Forest in Ontariosince early December 2002. The WhiskeyJack Forest is currently licensed to Abitibi-Consolidated, paper supplier to at least
one UK publishing house. The majority ofthe Whiskey Jack Forest is an ancientboreal forest ecosystem, with jack pine andblack spruce. The community has sufferedsevere problems with flooding due todamming and industrial logging. There hasalso been a history of mercury poisoningdue to pulp effluent in the area. The First
Nation believes that there has beenimproper consultation in defining loggingrights on their traditional lands.

6 7SOUTH EAST ASIA: INDO NESIAN
FORESTS ON THE BRINK
‘Indonesia is almost certainly undergoing
a species extinction spasm of planetaryproportions.’ 
World Bank Report, 2001
A number of UK publishing houses have
confirmed that some of their children’stitles are printed in South East Asia,including China, Japan, Korea, Singaporeand Thailand. As this guide goes to press,no information has been providedregarding paper sourcing. Within SouthEast Asia, Indonesia remains a majorsupplier of pulp and paper products. Illegaland destructive logging is decimatingIndonesia’s rainforests and is linked tocorruption, fraud, human rights abuses andarmed conflict. It is estimated that 88% oflogging in Indonesia is illegal. The country
is experiencing the highest rate of forestloss in the world and has the longest list ofendangered species in the world. 
9
A recent World Bank report warns that thelowland rainforests of Kalimantan andSumatra will be destroyed by 2010 ifcurrent logging rates continue.
10Not only
will these forests be lost forever but withthem hope for species like the orang-utan,whose numbers have declined by 50% inthe last ten years. BE PART OF THE SOLUTION
‘The campaign is a good opportunity for
authors to play their part in helping topreserve the world’s ancient forests byensuring that the paper used in theirbooks is not made with trees from ancient forests.’ 
Philip Pullman, Author of the Dark
Materials Trilogy, June 2003
Greenpeace is calling on the publishing
industry to take action to phase out theuse of paper coming from the destructionof ancient forests and to adoptenvironmentally and socially responsibleprocurement policies that will help protectthe world’s last remaining ancient forests.
GO ANCIENT FOREST FRIENDLY
You can only ensure that your paper
comes from environmentally and sociallyresponsible sources by using paper that ismade from recycled and/or FSC fibres.
•Buy recycled paper with a high post-
consumer waste content to help takepressure off the world’s ancient forests.
•Buy FSC paper to ensure that the 
fibre comes from forests that are wellmanaged to strong ecological and social criteria.
HOW PUBLISHERS ARE ALREADY
PART OF THE SOLUTION
Canada’s success story
The Great Bear Rainforest on the West
Coast of Canada is one of the last intact
temperate rainforests in the world. It is theonly habitat in the world where the whitespirit bear, a subspecies of the black bear,can be found. This bear, like two-thirds ofthe other 140,000 species of plants andanimals that live in Canada, is dependenton ancient forests for its survival in thewild. However, despite these forests’ primeecological importance, 40% of the timberlogged in Canada’s ancient temperaterainforests and 65% of the timber loggedin its ancient boreal forests is processed toproduce paper.WHAT IS THE FOREST STEWARDSHIP
COU NCIL (FSC)?
‘Forests subject to commercial exploitation
should be certified under the ForestStewardship Council certificationscheme.’ 
Prince Philip, President Emeritus 
of World Wide Fund for Nature, 1998
FSC is the only forest certification scheme
supported by environmental groups suchas Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth andWWF. Progressive companies in thetimber trade and indigenous peoples’organisations also support the FSC. 
The FSC manages the only
internationally recognised forestcertification standard that ensuresbuyers that timber comes fromenvironmentally and socially responsibleforest management. The FSC hascertified nearly 37 million hectares offorests and plantations in 56 countries –the largest global forest certificationsystem. Products carrying the FSC logo meet
the internationally recognised FSCPrinciples and Criteria of ForestStewardship, which cover environmental,social and economic issues. The logo isused with a Chain of Custodycertification number, which allowsanyone to trace the source of thatmaterial to a named company and toidentify the particular forest where thewood fibres originated.

certification and why FSC provides theonly real assurance that forest productsare from environmentally and sociallyresponsible sources see

WHAT’S THE SOLUTION? GOING ANCIENT FOREST FRIENDLY


8 9In 2000, the Canadian Markets Initiative
was established to help develop practicaland economic ways for Canadian bookpublishers to shift away from using paperderived from ancient forest destruction andto help them switch to ecologically soundalternatives.
11When the Markets Initiative started,
Canada’s publishing houses were largelysourcing virgin wood pulp from Canadianforests, with a high percentage fromancient forests. No publishers wereconsistently printing on recycled paper, noprinters stocked ancient forest friendlypapers, and no such paper was being
produced as a standard book sheet. 
As a direct result of this initiative, 35
Canadian publishers – including RandomHouse Canada and Penguin Canada –have made formal commitments to phaseout ancient forest fibres from theirpublications over a three-year period. Thishas created an unprecedented shift indemand. Today, five recycled papers havebeen developed for the Canadian market,all of which contain at least 60% post-consumer waste. New Leaf Paper, a USpaper supplier, is also developing two FSCcertified book papers – Good News Offsetand Eco Book FSC – which are expectedto be launched towards the end of 2003.See the table below for more details ofthese ancient forest friendly papers.
Since 2000, the Markets Initiative has had
several further major achievements:
•Three million books have been 
printed on recycled paper made frompost-consumer waste. 
•Six major Canadian book printers
now stock ancient forest friendly papers. 
•Forty-five leading Canadian authors
have pledged to support the campaign,
including Margaret Atwood, MichaelOndaatje, Yann Martel and Alice Munro.

SAVE FORESTS – FIRSTCANADIAN PRINT RUN PRINTEDON RECYCLED PAPER
Raincoast Books, the Canadian
co-publisher of Harry Potter (in partnershipwith Bloomsbury), has worked a little of itsown magic for biodiversity and the world’sforests by printing the Canadian edition of
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
on ancient forest friendly paper. The
approximately one million copies of theCanadian edition are the only ones in theworld to be printed on 100% post-consumer recycled paper.
The initiative won praise from the author,
JK Rowling, and a special message for
Canadian readers:
‘The forest at Hogwarts is home to
magical creatures like unicorns andcentaurs. Because the Canadian editionsare printed on Ancient Forest Friendlypaper, the Harry Potter books are helpingto save magnificent forests in the muggleworld, the home of magical animals such
as orang-utans, wolves and bears, it is agood idea to respect ancient trees,especially if they have a temper like theWhomping Willow.’
The ancient forest friendly paper, is 100%
post-consumer recycled and processedchlorine-free. Raincoast spokesperson,
Tessa Vanderkop said: 
‘We’re hoping thehigh profile of the Harry Potter books will
raise awareness and help to get otherpublishers on board. That would helpdrive the paper cost down and make itmore affordable.’
Before the project began, no mills were
sourcing recycled book paper in Canada.To print these books, Raincoast used
Badger Paper Mills in Wisconsin.
Raincoast is now also working with aQuebec mill, Cascades Inc., to print some
of its autumn runs. Raincoast is nowprinting approximately 80% of its uncoatedtitles on ancient forest friendly papers andmost of its office papers are also free ofancient forest fibre. 
By printing 
Harry Potter and the Order of
the Phoenix on 100% post-consumer,
processed chlorine-free paper, RaincoastBooks is making significant ecological
savings. This includes:
•39,320 trees
•63,435,801 litres of water
(enough water to fill 42 Olympic
sized swimming pools)
•854,988 kgs of solid waste 
•electricity to power the average
home for 262 years
•greenhouse gases equivalent to
driving a car 5.3 million kilometers
Nicole Rycroft of the Markets Initiative
believes Raincoast has really pushed theissue to the forefront with 
Harry Potter :
‘We’re now working with other publishers
who want to switch over to this kind ofpaper. It’s a good business decision,they’re seeing the kind of positive publicityit can bring.’

10 11‘We are committed to implementing
policies that will facilitate the conservationof ancient forests around the world andensure that we are not contributing to the destruction of irreplaceable naturaltreasures.’ 
Random House Canada, October, 2001
PHASE ONE: DEVELOPING 
AN ACTION PLAN
1. Establish a paper procurement policy
Developing a paper procurement policy is
essential. This should include a statementabout your company’s goal to purchaseancient forest friendly products. Aprocurement policy sets out your intentionsand acts as a yardstick by which tomeasure progress. It should also includetargets and timelines for implementation.The first priority is the removal of ancient
forest fibre from your supply chain.This should be followed by the
procurement of paper from environmentallyand socially responsible sources. Thepolicy needs to acknowledge that at thistime the only way you can be sure of this isthrough the purchase of virgin fibre at leastto the standard of FSC and/or recycledpaper. Both aspects of the policy shouldcontain ambitious timelines. Based on theCanadian experience, we suggest a threeyear timeframe in which to transfer youruncoated paper stocks away from ancientforests. Coated stocks may take longer.2. Trace your current supply 
chain back to source
To control your paper usage, you need to
identify each of the virgin fibre papers youuse and trace them back to their forest oforigin. This requires co-operation fromevery stage of your supply chain. A modelletter and model chain of custody form isprovided on pages 14 and 15.
Clearly communicate your intentions to your
suppliers as they are stakeholders in thisprocess. We suggest that you write tothem and request a signed audit statement,using the model chain of custody form (seeover), detailing the following information:
•The products you buy from them.
•The percentage of uncertified/certified
pulp in these products and thecertification system used to evaluate thispulp (for example, PEFC or FSC).
•The names of the companies and mills
supplying these products.
•The location, region and country
supplying the virgin fibre for theseproducts.
•The guarantees that you have been given
to ensure that the product is not from anancient forest (for example, signedstatements from your suppliers).
3. Phase out paper from ancient forests
The chain of custody form should alert you
to the areas in your supply chain that needmost urgent attention.
Work with your suppliers to go ancient
forest friendly within a set timeframe. Youshould consider writing contractual clausesthat make it clear to current and futuresuppliers that your company will notpurchase ancient forest products. A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO GOINGANCIENT FOREST FRIENDLY

MAGAZINE PAPER
‘As the country’s third largest magazine
publisher, consuming over 50,000 tonnesof paper a year, we felt we had a duty toour readers to assure them that we weresourcing our paper responsibly. As morepaper becomes available, we intend tomigrate all 37 of our BBC titles, includingRadio Times, Gardeners World and Top
Of The Pops, on to FSC-certified stock.’
David Halford from BBC Worldwide 
In December 2000, BBC Wildlife
magazine became the world’s firstconsumer magazine to carry the FSC logo,the only logo to guarantee that the timberused to make the paper comes fromenvironmentally and socially responsibleforest management. The FSC’s permissionto use the logo followed a strict chain ofcustody procedure involving the forestowners, paper manufacturers, printers andpublishers. The FSC paper is produced inSweden by SCA at its Ortviken mill.
CANADIAN PUBLISHER
MCCLELLAND & STEWARTCOMMITS TO ANCIENTFOREST FRIENDLY POLICY
‘Supporting this initiative is one step
we can take towards ending globaldeforestation and climate change.’ 
Krys Ross, General Manager,
McClelland & Stewart, October 2001
McClelland & Stewart was one of the
first Canadian publishers to adopt anancient forest friendly policy in 2001.As one of Canada’s most prominentliterary publishers, its leadership indeveloping a formal commitment waskey to encouraging many otherpublishers to move forward with this initiative. 
McClelland & Stewart has proactively
implemented its policy. At thebeginning, the company paid apremium for the paper but offset mostof the additional cost by creativeproduction techniques. For example, it decided not to dual laminate oremboss its covers. Today, McClelland& Stewart pays no additional cost forprinting on ancient forest friendlypapers, having negotiated a deal withits printers.
Approximately 66% of McClelland &
Stewart’s uncoated titles are nowprinted on paper that is ancient forestfriendly. All McClelland & Stewart’sflagship fiction titles are printed onancient forest friendly paper includingbooks by Canadian literary icons likeAlice Munro, Margaret Atwood andRohinton Mistry. McClelland & Stewarthas just printed its one hundredth titleon ancient forest friendly paper.

12 13PHASE TWO: SWITCHING TO
RECYCLED AND/OR FSC PAPER
The only way to guarantee that your paper
is from environmentally and sociallyresponsible sources is to purchase eitherrecycled paper made from post-consumerwaste, FSC certified paper, or paper whichis a combination of the two. Today, theavailability of suitable recycled and FSCbook papers in the EU is limited. However,the experience in Canada suggests thatthis situation will change rapidly once thepublishing industry demands it. Youroptions at this time are:
1. Buy currently available recycled paper
that is suitable for books
You may find that some of the recycled
paper and FSC paper that is currentlyavailable may be suitable for some of yourtitles. For example, Sunderland Paper Millproduces a recycled paper and SCAproduce an FSC improved newsprintgrade that has been used for books. You
can also source recycled book paper fromCascades and Newstech, the papermanufacturers leading the initiative inCanada. For a list of potential sourcingoptions see pages 16 and 1 7 .
2. Create a demand for recycled 
and/or FSC paper
The Canadian experience shows that
publishers can persuade paper suppliersto develop recycled and FSC book paperswithin relatively short time periods. Initially,Canadian publishers paid a premiumto get suppliers to research and developpapers to meet their exact specifications.However, today, as a result of thesignificant increases in demand for suchpapers on the Canadian market, publisherscan expect to pay less than 3% extra forrecycled book paper and in some casesthey pay no premium at all.Recycled paper
There is no legal definition for the term
‘recycled paper’. Some papers containpre-consumer waste such as printer’s trim, whilst others contain post-consumerwaste, which has been used in the market place and returned for recycling.The safest way to ensure your purchasing
decision most benefits the environment is to buy recycled paper made from post-consumer waste. Recycled paper orderedin large quantities is competitively priced alongside virgin fibre.[X PUBLISHER] is committed to protecting the environment and to the responsible use of natural resources.
As a book publisher, with paper a core part of our business, we are concerned about the future of theworld’s remaining ancient forests. We are committed to implementing policies that will encourageconservation of ancient forests globally. We aim to ensure that all paper products we purchase are derivedfrom environmentally and socially responsible sources – ie recycled products and /or those certified to thestandards of the Forest Stewardship Council. 
We will inform our suppliers of our purchasing preferences and work with them to ensure that our company’s
procurement policies are implemented. As of DATE we will implement the following guidelines for all ourpaper purchasing:
1.We will phase out all paper products derived from intact ancient forests and other High Conservation
Value Forests unless strict conservation safeguards are in place.
2.We will give preference to paper products made with a high recycled fibre content sourced from post-
consumer waste.
3.We will develop an action plan for ensuring that all virgin fibre is procured from forests independently
certified to at least the level of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) principles and criteria.
4.In order to verify achievement of the above steps, we will immediately establish a system that allows us
to trace timber products back to specific forest management units. 
5.We will develop timelines for achieving the above objectives.
Great grey owl, Finland ©Leinonen/GreenpeaceMODEL PAPER PROCUREMENT POLICY FOR PUBLISHING HOUSES

Dear supplier,
I am writing to let you know that as of [DAY/MONTH/YEAR] we will be introducing a new paper
procurement policy with the aim of ensuring that we only procure paper from environmentally andsocially responsible sources. We ask for your co-operation, as a valued supplier, to help us with theimplementation of this policy .
It has recently been brought to our attention that paper products we use may contain wood fibre derived
from ancient forests. We wish to alter this situation and are keen to explore how we can obtain suppliesof either recycled paper made from post-consumer waste and/or paper independently certified toForest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards.
In implementing our new policy , we wish to work where possible with our current suppliers to obtain
paper supplies that satisfy our new requirements, whilst maintaining valuable business relationships. To thisend, we need to conduct an audit of our current paper supplies so that we can accurately identify theoriginal forest sources of all the paper products we purchase. We would therefore be grateful if you couldcomplete the accompanying Chain of Custody Verification audit form within the next 30 days.
The audit is intended to establish five key points:
1.The products we buy from you2.Whether the wood fibre we currently purchase is certified and, if so, by what standard (for example,
uncertified, Pan European Certification Scheme, Finnish Forest Certification Scheme, CanadianStandard Association scheme) 
3.The original suppliers of any virgin wood fibre used4.Where their related forest operations are located 5.What guarantees you have been given to ensure that these forest operations do not contribute to the
degradation of ancient forests areas
We are aware that some of this information may not be easy to obtain. If you are unable to answer any of
this audit with confidence, due to a lack of information, please contact us so that we can discuss how totake this forward.
We appreciate your help with this audit and look forward to working positively with you on these issues.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.
