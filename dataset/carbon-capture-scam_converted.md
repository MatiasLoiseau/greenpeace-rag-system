Tragically, the captured CO2 collected via carbon capture
will become a catalyst for even more CO2 pollution.

Introduction

Human-caused, global climate disruption demands
we quickly phase-out the burning of fossil fuels
as an energy source.1 It turns out that turning on
the lights does not require incessantly extracting,
processing and transporting combustion fuels that
produce unwanted toxins, pollution and waste. The
Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution analysis (E[R]), as
well as many others, demonstrates there is a pathway
to a renewable energy economy in time to stop the
worst impacts of global warming.2

Many politicians and industry leaders, however,
refuse to let go of the combustion economy, and
waste valuable time and resources on false solutions.
Nothing epitomizes destructive political procrastina-
tion on climate more than promoting carbon capture
for coal-fired power plants.

The CCS myth posits that the economy could
continue to burn fossil fuels without the harmful effect
of global warming. CCS is regarded as the last hope
for the coal extraction industry, even as the industry
is loath to acknowledge the need to reduce carbon
pollution. Electric utilities don’t really care if CCS
works or not, but they are willing to take public money
to see if it does.

Oil companies have proven a strong ally of carbon
capture because it provides them with a ready source
of subsidized CO2 that they can inject into reservoirs
to extract more oil. Support for CCS delays the transi-
tion to renewables. In no uncertain terms, political
and financial support for carbon capture hurts the
climate. Tragically, the captured CO2 collected via
carbon capture will become a catalyst for even more
CO2 pollution.

Burning fossil fuels for electricity is the number one
source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, the most
predominant greenhouse gas and most problematic
climate pollutant over the long term.i Burning coal is
the number one source of CO2 from the electricity
sector.3 The proposed carbon rule from the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding
future power plants would affect only new coal
plants.4

The EPA rule abandons the ‘S’ in CCS. No longer
must the CO2 be sequestered from the atmo-
sphere. Instead, the EPA carbon rule would be a
protocol for how carbon capture must be used
to increase supply of oil. EPA must rethink this
rule before it is finalized.

The facade of the proposed EPA rule should not be
surprising given the history of how carbon capture
technology has developed. However, it will be
disappointing if President Obama’s environmental
agency validates this expensive political distraction.
Fortunately, EPA may be wavering when it comes to
basing its proposed rule on the idea that scrubbing
CO2 from new coal plants is a good investment.5

This report focuses on four reasons why EPA will be
right to ditch support for carbon capture.

•  Even data from the federal government, a

proponent of CCS, shows CCS would be the
costliest way to reduce CO2 pollution caused by
electricity production.

•

Increasing oil extraction is the real goal of
developing CO2 capture. Capturing carbon
means more, not less, climate pollution in the
atmosphere.

•  CO2 leakage is a worsening gamble. And

people, not polluters, bear the risk.

•  CCS threatens to make the overall environmental

impact of using fossil fuels worse.

i Methane, 86 to 105 times more warming than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, is a greater

problem in the short term. http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-
warming-and-energy/science/Natural-Gas-and-Global-Warming

“[Carbon capture] will eventually mature
and become as common for new power
plants as scrubbers have become for
well-controlled plants today.”

-Gina McCarthy, EPA Administrator 6

CCS Is A Costly Distraction
That Cannot Save The Climate

“CCS is the only proven set of technology that will allow us to cut carbon
pollution while still using coal.”
-Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL)7

CCS is a tempting solution for decisionmakers who
prioritize the next election over leadership. CCS al-
lows politicians to call for action on climate in a way
that doesn’t upset their fossil fuel campaign donors.
It is neither electric utilities nor coal producers who
give life to the idea that CCS is a climate solution.
A 2012 study found that “the discourse is not really
about CCS but politics in the form of narratives on
promises, alliances and emotions caused by political
actions.”8 Few country’s elected leaders have
pushed CCS as much as in the US, the country
responsible for the most climate pollution already in
the atmosphere.9 And they have been egged on by
techno-optimistic, fossil fuel-friendly analysis coming
from places like the International Energy Agency and
Global CCS Institute.

“In fact, the president is trying to
create a future for coal.”
-Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA)10

CCS as Climate Solution

CCS proponents claim that carbon capture-enabled
coal plants would provide “the greatest reductions
in future US electric sector CO2 emissions” and
highlight the urgency with which CCS must be ap-
plied in order to achieve these benefits.11 One report
went so far as to assert that applying CCS to all
coal plants would result in greater GHG reductions
than implementing renewables across half the U.S.
electric grid.12

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has described
CCS as “a necessity for a world hooked on fossil
fuel.” IEA estimated that CCS could achieve as much
as 20% of the cumulative CO2 reductions needed by
2050 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change,13
although later lowered its estimate to 14%.14

The International Energy Agency (IEA) is right to
increasingly focus on renewable energy over fossil
fuels, a dynamic reinforced as solar and wind
development soars and communities work energeti-
cally to divest from coal, oil and gas.15

“CCS as a magical technology that solves the carbon problem
for coal plants is oversold.”
–Jim Rogers, former CEO and Board chair of Duke Energy24

A Federal Embrace

In 1997, the US Department of Energy (DOE) launched
the Carbon Storage Program, which undertakes CCS
research and development, infrastructure, and global
partnerships.25 Both the Bush (second) and Obama
administrations have backed the FutureGen CCS
project in Illinois, first in the form of a new hydrogen
plant, then later as a revamped oil plant.

The IEA acknowledged that CCS would have a long
way to go before providing much of a climate benefit.16
Lessons learned from a series of failed CCS projects
reveal numerous technical, economic, social and
regulatory risks.17 IEA’s analysis assumed, wrongly,
that the captured carbon would indeed be seques-
tered, rather than used to augment the supply of other
fossil fuels.

In 2009, IEA published its first “technology roadmap”
for developing CCS quickly enough to avoid the worst
impacts of climate change. Also in pursuit of avoiding
climate catastrophe, countries have since agreed in
the United Nations climate negotiations to keep global
temperature from rising above 2 degrees Celsius (3.6
degrees Fahrenheit).18 Many countries, supported by
climate scientists, believe the goal should be to keep
warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees
Fahrenheit).19

Guided by the 2 degree goal, IEA set a global
benchmark that CCS should be successfully seques-
tering about 300 megatons per annum (mtpa) of CO2
with 100 commercial-scale projects by 2020.20 In 2013
IEA dramatically reduced this benchmark, to only 30
projects sequestering 50 mpta, or less than 1/10th of
1% of global CO2 emissions. Projects in the pipeline
for completion by 2020 will also fail to meet this
reduced target.21

IEA explained in a footnote of its revised CCS
roadmap report that “[t]he 2030 and 2050 goals are
in line with the [2 degree scenario] deployment vision,
and will require accelerated action from 2020 to be
met.”22 In other words, the failure to develop CCS as
quickly as they had hoped just means we must now
do more over a shorter time period. This explanation
is impractical from an economic perspective, and
reflects denial about the climate change time line.
Even if IEA’s ambitious CCS roadmap succeeds, it
will not be much help. 2020 is the latest year GHG
emissions must peak, and we may surpass 2 degrees
by 2036 with the current trend.23

Carbon Capture Scam  Chapter: 1“The new [EPA] proposal sets a separate standard for coal-based units and
requires the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which is
neither adequately demonstrated nor economically feasible.”
-Thomas Kuhn, President of the Edison Electric Institute.29

In 2010, the Obama White House commissioned
a CCS “Task Force” of federal departments and
agencies to devise recommendations for “bringing
5 to 10 commercial demonstration projects online
by 2016.”26 That same year, the Task Force claimed
that CCS faced “no insurmountable technological,
legal, institutional, or other barriers that prevent CCS
from playing a role in reducing GHG emissions.”
But from an economic standpoint, the Task Force
concluded that to be deployed at a relevant scale, a
price on carbon is necessary – a prospect which has
fallen from the horizon.27 By the time the Task Force
released its recommendations, the US had nonethe-
less already invested more in carbon capture than any
other national government, as below details.28

Following the Task Force Report, Senators Jeff
Bingaman (D-NM), John Barrasso (R-WY), Jay
Rockefeller (R-WV) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) intro-
duced the “Department of Energy Carbon Capture
and Sequestration Program Amendments Act of
2011.” The bill aimed to “authorize the Secretary of
Energy to carry out a program to demonstrate the
commercial application of integrated systems for
long-term geological storage of carbon dioxide” for up
to 10 demonstration projects.30

The following year, Representative David McKinley
(R-WV) introduced H.R. 6172 to “prohibit the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency
from finalizing any rule imposing any standard of
performance for carbon dioxide emissions from any
existing or new source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric
utility generating unit unless and until carbon capture
and storage is found to be technologically and
economically feasible.”31

At first blush, it may seem like the Bingaman and
McKinley initiatives were at odds, but in fact they were
politically consistent. The coal extraction industry
sees CCS as useful only insofar as it will delay EPA
regulations on CO2. Operators of coal-fired power
plants have little or no interest in carbon capture, and
they are likely opposed unless public money covers
the cost.

Legislation introduced in the previous Congress by
Senator Rockefeller would have expanded tax incen-
tives, loan guarantees, and other federal subsidies
for CCS.32 It was not due to lack of support that
new incentives never came to a vote, but more likely
because the 112th and 113th Congresses were the
first and second most dysfunctional in history.33 That
Members of Congress are influenced by campaign
donations from the oil industry was illustrated clearly
in the January 2015 debate about the Keytone XL
pipeline.34 Members who voted for a bill approving
the pipeline received 13 times more money from the
oil and gas industry compared with legislators voting
against the pipeline.35

Carbon capture projects already have access to
substantial federal tax incentives thanks to bipartisan
legislation passed in previous years. Power sector
tax credits include a 20 percent investment tax credit
for carbon capture coal projects using integrated
gasification combined cycle technology (IGCC), or
a 15 percent credit for non-IGCC projects. These
credits were established in the National Energy Policy
Act of 2005. In addition, the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008 created tax credits per ton
of captured CO2. Capped at 75 million tons, CO2
captured and injected for geological storage receives
a credit of $20 per ton, whereas CO2 used for
increasing oil extraction receives a $10 per ton credit.
President Obama’s 2016 budget request would add
another $2 billion in tax incentives for carbon capture
projects.36

Currently, DOE runs a number of programs to
support carbon capture. This includes the Regional
Carbon Sequestration Partnerships, which covers
the entire contiguous United States, comprised of
seven regional partnerships that aim to research and
develop storage sites for captured carbon to which it
has allocated about $100 million per year.38 The 2009
“American Recovery and Reinvestment Act” (ARRA)
allocated significant ongoing funding to carbon
capture, $3.4 billion annually, in order to develop and
deploy carbon capture, primarily with the Clean Coal
Power Initiative (CCPI). DOE also administers loan
guarantees for carbon capture projects.39

Page 7

Carbon Capture Scam  Chapter: 1“If our nation is to benefit from the next generation of clean coal
technology, the private sector needs greater certainty and robust
financial support in order to make the necessary investments.”
-Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV)37

For the CCPI, DOE has issued three solicitations for
projects. There remains only one project in the sec-
ond round dedicated to CCS, and three in the third
round. Under the loan guarantee program DOE has
only ever approved two applications for projects that
incorporated CCS, one of which would have used the
CO2 to increase oil extraction but was abandoned.40
DOE nonetheless is soliciting another $8 billion in loan
guarantees for “clean fossil energy innovation.”41

The loan guarantee program may not be as wasteful
in theory as a federal grant, but it still constitutes
a public subsidy in keeping with the World Trade
Organization definition of a subsidy – a financial con-
tribution by a government or any public body which
confers a benefit to a specific industry.42 In addition, a
Governmental Accountability Office report found that
half of federally guaranteed loans for energy projects
go into default, in which case the US taxpayer foots
the bill for any disbursement not recovered.43

With all the projects abandoned under the CCPI and
loan guarantee program, cost concerns were the
main issue cited. Thus, at the drafting of this report-
there remain four utility-scale CCS projects as part of
the CCPI, and every single one is intended to use the
scrubbed CO2 to increase oil extraction.

There was one other carbon capture power plant
project, FutureGen, which was a long saga begun
under President Bush in 2003, and revamped multiple
times. FutureGen was canceled in early 2015 for the
third time. The FutureGen cancellation was again
due to costs, as well as, reasonably, the likelihood it
would not meet the deadline for completion.44 Private
backers of FutureGen are suing in Illinois court to get
electricity ratepayers to cover their costs.45

Carbon Capture Scam  Chapter: 1Utility-Scale Carbon Capture
Projects in the United States

The prospect that any of the utility scale carbon capture
projects in the United States survives to completion
remains uncertain. However, a Canadian project began
operation in 2014, the only other large-scale carbon cap-
ture project in North America. In many ways the Canadian
project is similar to the four US projects on the table. Run
by SaskPower in Saskatchewan, Boundary Dam started
as a larger project. In the end it was a 110 megawatt coal
(lignite) plant retrofit. The Canadian government provided
$240 million in funding for a 300 megawatt plant, although
Saskpower was able to keep the full subsidy. The provin-
cial government is also providing financial support. Most of
the CO2 scrubbed from smokestacks is used to increase
oil extraction, which Saskpower is selling for about $25
million per year under a 10-year contract.46 Boundary Dam
is one tenth the size of the average new coal plant project,
but it is hailed by CCS proponents globally as the first
completed carbon capture project that is a power plant.47

Like Boundary Dam, all four US projects are receiving

Kemper County Energy Facility (Southern Company)

significant public funding – in one case more than the
construction cost of the plant if guaranteed loans are
included. The US projects are also significantly smaller
than the average new coal plant. Cost overruns are typical,
often scandalously high. While these projects all receive
public subsidies to keep CO2 from entering the atmo-
sphere, paradoxically all of them would sell the scrubbed
CO2 to the oil extraction industry.

At the Kemper plant in Mississippi, Southern Company
would earn $50 million to $100 million annually selling
byproducts, mostly the captured CO2.48

paradoxically all of them would sell the

nonviable from a financial standpoint.

A Tragic Waste of Scarce Public Dollars

Billions of dollars of taxpayer money have already
been spent on CCS under President Obama and his
predecessors, but this is just a new type of fossil fuel
subsidy. Oil and gas have received federal subsidies
since 1916, about 60 years longer than renewables.59
According to a 2011 study, cumulative federal
subsidies over time for oil, gas, coal, and nuclear
were $630 billion, versus $50 billion for renewables.60
Despite significant public financing, CCS remains an
exceedingly expensive and uneconomic investment
for reducing climate pollution in the electricity sector.

Continued cost declines in the renewable sector,
cheaper gas due to the rise of fracking, and public
requirements on non-climate pollutants have driven
down domestic coal demand. The utility industry and
government project a continued decrease in coal use
by the power sector.61 Companies mining coal in the
United States are therefore turning to international
coal demand to stay in business. Fortunately, coal

demand is not expected to rise for much longer
in target markets like China.62 In the immediate
future, however, coal exports threaten to maintain or
increase CO2 emissions from burning US coal, even
as less coal is burned in the US. The industry and
its allies nonetheless claim that coal exports would
be good for the environment, but they are obviously
grasping at straws.63

While politicians may claim that CCS is the future for
coal demand, the truth is that coal has no future. The
Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution scenario shows coal
phased out in less than two decades, while we leave
behind fracked gas as well (See Figure 1 comparing
Greenpeace scenario to the gloomy forecast of the
US Energy Information Administration).64

Carbon Capture Scam  Chapter: 1“[I]n Pennsylvania, that’s a little less realistic for us unless we want to build a
pipeline to Texas for our CO2, which I don’t think is quite practical… [i]t’s not
something that could work in my neck of the woods.”
-Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA)72

Existing coal-fired power plants still remain the
number one source of territorial US carbon pollution,
and the new EPA carbon standard for existing power
plants is imminent.66 Policymakers have historically
emphasized retrofitting power stations through the
addition of post-combustion carbon capture technol-
ogy. This option has proven too expensive to be
feasible even with significant support from taxpayers
and ratepayers.

For a fiscally prudent CCS advocate, the fact that we
currently use fossil fuels for electricity is irrelevant. The
question they must answer is why new power plants
with CCS are preferable to any other new energy
investment, such as wind farms, solar arrays, or ef-
ficiency measures. But economics matter less when
public funds are available. In addition, the oil industry
may be increasingly willing to cover costs in order to
obtain CO2 for use in increasing oil extraction.

Pipelines are the most likely method for moving cap-
tured CO2 to storage locations. In some cases CO2
could be transported by ships, rail or road transport.
CO2 transport via pipeline can be a relatively low risk
endeavor, but building new pipelines across public
and private property will come with legal obstacles
and costs. Attempting to meet climate targets with
CCS in the United States would require up to 23,000
miles of additional CO2 pipelines between power
plants and geological storage sites that could be a
thousand miles away.70 Operation and maintenance
of this pipeline infrastructure could cost up to a $220
million per year,71 an estimate which would be a small
fraction of the cost of any utility-scale carbon capture
project. However, most if not all new CO2 pipelines
are being built to extraction sites rather than to sites
intended for geological sequestration.

Relative to what carbon capture projects have cost to
date, most analyses of cost estimates are exceedingly
generous. One collection of studies, for example,
estimates the capital cost for post-combustion
equipment at $1,604 per kilowatt of capacity67,
meaning a power station of only 500 MW would cost
$800 million to retrofit. This figure does not include
the costs of transportation and storage of CO2, nor
does it account for the energy use of the capture
system itself. The power consumption of capture and
compression equipment may reduce the effective
generating capacity of the 500 MW plant to 350 MW,
since the energy penalty can be from 20–30%.

The US Department of Energy conducted a separate
study and estimated capital costs of $1,319 per
kilowatt to retrofit post-combustion capture, with a
31% loss in energy output as a result. 68 Capital costs
of retrofitting using oxy-firing technology are also high,
on the order of $1,044 to $1,060 per kilowatt with
reductions of 33–36% of power output.69

Integrating CCS into new, pre-combustion capture
stations is widely agreed to be the least expensive.
Retrofitting the existing power plant fleet is therefore
nonviable from a financial standpoint.

Given the opportunity cost of energy
investments, proponents of CCS must
show how it is cost effective compared
with other ways to reduce the climate
footprint of electricity production. But
this is an impossibility. There is no
escaping that CCS is more expensive
per kilowatt hour than investing in new
power generation from renewables.
Based on a 2013 study, taking into ac-
count life cycle CO2 emissions of each
source and cost of new investment,
CCS for coal is 124 times less cost
effective than wind energy per gram of
avoided CO2 pollution. This exorbitant
difference includes only the price
of electricity infrastructure and only
climate pollution. It does not account
for any of the widespread public health
costs of using coal.77

Tacking CCS onto a traditional coal
plant is estimated to increase the
plant’s operating costs by about
75% according to the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO). CBO thus
concluded in 2012 that CCS could not
take off in the utility industry without
the backing of some federal restric-
tion on carbon emissions.73 This
conclusion does not differ greatly from
that of the Obama administration’s
Interagency Task Force on Carbon
Capture and Storage.74

Of the six projects to receive funding
under round three of the Department
of Energy (DOE) Clean Coal Power
Initiative, three withdrew as of April
2012. In each case, it was revealed
that cost concerns played a role in
the withdrawal. Large-scale CCS
demonstration projects have access
to about $21.4 billion in funding across
the globe.75 Currently, more unal-
located public funding is available to
the US power sector than in any other
country.76

While the US Energy Information
Administration, part of DOE, has been
sympathetic to CCS in its analysis,
its own cost projections for new
energy sources show that CCS is the
most expensive method of avoiding
additional CO2 emissions.78 In Figure
2 we compare the cost of avoiding
a kilogram of CO2 emissions per
unit of electricity (kilowatt hour). See
Appendix I for an explanation of the
methodology. This chart uses refer-
enced data that is very sympathetic to
CCS, even beyond EIA cost figures.
It assumes a 90% capture rate and
that bituminous coal is burned, which
has the lowest CO2 emissions per
unit of energy.79 It assumes very low
life cycle GHG emissions from coal.80
It assumes the the most efficient new
coal plants (IGCC).

However, we know that coal plants
are often using lower quality lignite or
sub-bituminous coal, may have lower
capture rates (65% for Kemper), cost
far more in part because they are
retrofits, and aren’t even intending
to sequester the CO2. So, Figure 2
is overly fair to CCS. Nonetheless, it
shows CCS would cost almost 40%
more per kilogram of avoided CO2
than solar PV, 125% more than wind,
and 260% more than geothermal.

Carbon Capture Scam  Chapter: 12

Capturing Carbon Will
Increase Climate Pollution

they must assume that a critical majority of the injected CO2 eventually
stays underground. Unfortunately, this assumption fails.

Australia, the second largest exporter of coal after
Indonesia, announced in 2009 a new initiative
called the Global CCS Institute to promote CCS
development world-wide.82 The Institute says the
business case for carbon capture rests on the ‘twin
pillars’ of public support and market opportunity.83
The exorbitant cost of CCS and political difficulty in
generating taxpayer support has made proponents
turn more and more to market opportunity, at the
expense of theoretical integrity in the argument that
CCS could help the climate.

CC-EOR Is an Oil Industry Strategy

CCS proponents do not bother to hide that the
major selling point behind carbon capture is its
role in ‘enhanced oil recovery’ (EOR) – which is not
a better method of cleaning up spilled oil, as one
might guess the term means. They aren’t recovering
oil, since they never had it in the first place. And
‘enhanced’ doesn’t mean any improvement in qual-
ity. In fact, the oil is more highly saturated with CO2,
so it’s worse for the climate. EOR is a euphemism for
increasing oil extraction.

Responsible for 6% of U.S. oil production today,
up from virtually nothing in the 1980s, industry
claims to have been using CO2-EOR for more than
three decades. CO2-EOR works by pumping CO2
underground to force out oil that otherwise could
not be extracted.84 Some claim that without CO2
injection 65% of the oil would be left underground.85
In other words, under the auspices of helping the
climate, carbon capture will be used to increase oil
extraction by as much as 185%.

are to operate in the low carbon future we must achieve.”
-Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR)98

Currently, CO2-EOR operations rely mostly on CO2
extracted directly from natural CO2 reservoirs, usually
in close proximity to oil rigs. Natural CO2 supplies are
exhaustible and really only available in the United
States, although the rising demand for anthropogenic
CO2 to increase oil extraction is global.86 In the
Permian Basin demand for CO2 by the oil industry
began to exceed supply in 2004.87

The majority of CO2-EOR operations are in Permian
Basin (Texas and New Mexico), where high-quality
CO2 sources reside near oil reservoirs “amenable”
to EOR.89 One analysis called EOR “the main driver
behind CCS,” which was before federal regulations on
GHG emissions.90 Oil companies, such as BP, view
CO2-EOR as the only way to maintain or increase
production.91 Another analyst rightly noted, “...not only
does CCS need CO2-EOR to help provide economic
viability for CCS, but CO2-EOR also needs CCS in
order to ensure adequate carbon dioxide supplies to
facilitate growth in production from EOR.”92 In 2010
there were already 129 CO2-EOR projects – only one
was labeled as a CCS project.93

The oil industry has viewed carbon capture with EOR
(CC-EOR) as a key part of their expansion before any
public relations work to greenwash it.

No Green Stamp

The logical foundation of proponents of CC-EOR
is presented in a 2012 report commissioned by the
National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative (NEORI).
The report states “[i]n a fortunate, if ironic, twist of
fate, a key to increasing America’s domestic energy
security lies in capturing and productively utilizing
a portion of our nation’s industrial CO2 emissions,
thereby meeting a critical domestic energy challenge,
while also helping to solve a global environmental
problem.”

NEORI describes itself as a diverse set of con-
stituents. While three of NEORI’s 35 members and
observers are environmental NGOs, the overwhelm-
ing majority have a stake in carbon capture or EOR
whether or not there is a climate benefit.94 They are
surely quite happy to call it ‘green tech.’ NEORI has
succeeded in getting their recommendations into
legislative proposals, such as tax credits proposed by
Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV).95

Since 95% of oil is extracted to be burned, thus
creating more CO2 pollution, there is no simple logic
that using CO2 to increase oil supply benefits the
climate.96 CC-EOR proponents making a case for
the climate therefore must rely on a set of elaborate
political economic assumptions.

Even if they admit that there is some reduction in the
climate benefit, they must assume that a critical
majority of the injected CO2 eventually stays
underground. Unfortunately, this assumption fails.
One reaason is that extraction companies do not
re-capture the CO2 during production. An analysis of
existing CO2-EOR operations noted that “accounting
for CO2 losses is not typically done for EOR.”97 That is
not surprising because for oil companies sequestra-
tion of CO2 is not an objective – growth of their
industry is.

Page 16

Carbon Capture Scam  Chapter: 2The second false assumption is that CC-EOR
makes strategic sense for scaling up invest-
ment in CCS in general. The Global CCS Institute,
NEORI, and others claim that this shrewdly harnesses
oil industry profit incentive in order to augment overall
investment in CCS. This view may be theoretically
sound with respect to capital investment in general,
and perhaps with achieving economies of scale at
some point far into the future (too far to matter for
mitigating climate change). But it cannot be true when
it comes to building fixed infrastructure. It would not
be economical, nor practical, to take a) custom built
infrastructure designed to scrub CO2 from a new
lignite-fired power plant in Mississippi to pipe to an oil
extraction site less than 100 miles away (i.e., Kemper
plant) and then export it to b) retrofit a non-lignite coal
plant in China in order to sequester the CO2.

The NEORI optimism about harnessing private
oil investment appears to view oil money as finite
and public dollars as limitless – but they have it
backwards. Taxpayer dollars are scarce, whereas the
2014 revenue of the top 15 oil companies was about
$4 trillion,101 more than the entire US federal budget.
DOE claims to be subsidizing CC-EOR with the aim
to encourage CCS at a scale that would benefit the
climate, which means it is ignoring its own analysis. A
DOE-commissioned study concluded that “[CC-EOR]
is unlikely to serve as a major stepping stone to
commercial-scale CCS deployment.”102

There is no reason to believe industry practices are
geared toward anything but maximizing oil sales.
Creating an incentive for CC-EOR-with-Storage would
require heavy carbon taxation, according to the IEA.99
There is no such policy in the US, and it doesn’t ap-
pear the Republican-controlled Congress is anywhere
near considering a carbon tax.

There are few peer-reviewed studies of lifecycle
greenhouse gas emissions from CO2-EOR projects.
However, one study of five projects revealed that –
between mining coal capturing carbon from the coal
plant, utilizing the carbon for EOR, and burning the
produced oil – CC-EOR can result in a net increase in
carbon emissions.100

Achieving a net reduction in emissions would
require making sure that most of the injected CO2
does not escape with extracted oil, or at least that
it is ‘recycled’ (neither of which the proposed EPA
carbon rule on new coal plants would require). Even
then, the practice would have to be industry-wide.
If one company were obligated to capture the CO2
which returns to the surface with extracted oil, the
injected CO2 does not stay confined to one drilling
rig’s operations. As intended, injected CO2 becomes
mixed and dispersed with the oil underground, which
means it can be extracted by other companies’ drill
rigs as well. Thus, ‘recycling’ a critical majority of
injected CO2 may not even be physically possible in
many cases. There is also the problem of abandoned
wells, which the next chapter will discuss.

Carbon Capture Scam  Chapter: 2Oil companies have turned to EOR to be able to sell more
oil, after exhausting more easily obtainable supplies.

The third and most dubious assumption is
that oil companies choose not to develop
new wells if they can get more out of existing
wells. However, one might attempt to make this
‘zero sum production’ claim more rigorous. Analyst
Jaramillo says “[t]he key argument for CO2-EOR as
a sequestration method is that the electricity and oil
produced within the system boundary displaces oil or
electricity from other sources.” For example, assume
BP producing oil in the Gulf means Suncor produces
less carbon-intensive tar sands oil in Alberta. This
economic rationalization made by those with appar-
ent misgivings about supporting CC-EOR is obviously
a non sequitur.

Regarding Jaramillo’s point about sources of electric-
ity within the system boundary, investing in CC-EOR
arguably displaces investments in renewables if
it extends the life of a coal plant or results in new
coal-fired capacity that wind or solar could otherwise
provide.

The aforementioned DOE study found CC-EOR
contributes little if anything to CCS deployment in part
because CC-EOR momentum exists to make the oil
industry more profitable. It is clear that for the industry
this is about extracting more oil – growing more
as an industry – than they otherwise could. The oil
industry’s plans for profit growth are not just amoral
but myopically oriented toward selling as much oil as
possible.

Exxon CEO, Lee Raymond, famously declared that
the company was not American and did not make
decisions based on what’s good for America, but he
might as well have said that companies whose aim is
making money from oil supply do not make decisions
based on what’s good for the global economy or even
themselves.103 Climate disruption will impact all of us.

CC-EOR is no more a climate solution than drilling
in ultra-deepwater, hydro-fracking, or drilling in the
Arctic Ocean. These are just next steps for an indus-
try destroying the climate. Oil companies have turned
to EOR to be able to sell more oil, after exhausting
more easily obtainable supplies. There is no escaping
that, as Jaramillo states, “without displacement of a
carbon intensive energy source, CO2-EOR systems
will result in net carbon emissions.”104

Oil produced from injection of CO2 captured from
coal plants is arguably is worse than conventional
oil, since it is part of scheme to either build new
coal plants or keep existing plants from shuttering.
Emissions from CC-EOR will include emissions from
coal extraction, processing, new coal combustion (not
all the CO2 is captured), not to mention combustion
of oil that would otherwise stay in the ground.

World-wide, all but three of the thirteen large-scale,
carbon-capture projects to have begun operating
use the captured CO2 for EOR operations. None of
the three non-EOR operations is a power plant. They
are gas extraction operations designed to re-inject
underground the CO2 scrubbed from raw natural
gas. One of the three operations, in Algeria, was
suspended indefinitely in 2011. The other two are both
operated by Statoil in Norway. Statoil avoids paying
tens of millions of dollars per year under Norway’s
carbon tax system.105

The Global CCS Institute is of course optimistic that
EOR “is promoting early deployment of CCS.”106
However, even if one gives undue acknowledgement
to the other 40 carbon capture projects which the
Global CCS Institute documents on paper could
operate in the next decade, only 9 aim to sequester
CO2 captured from a power plant.107 FutureGen
would have been a 10th and was for quite a while
the most likely to succeed. FutureGen was the last
remaining large-scale carbon capture power plant
project in the US that aimed to sequester its CO2
pollution.

Sequestration is a Bad Bet;
People – not Polluters –
Bear the Risk

Once a CO2 molecule is emitted into the air, it can
take two centuries before it is reintegrated into
natural carbon sinks like forests. This report uses the
terms ‘storage’ and ‘sequestration’ interchangeably
because that is the norm, although it may be more
appropriate to say that storage implies ‘artificial
sequestration’ or the attempt by humans to seques-
ter CO2 at a scale and rate not possible naturally.

The problem with IEA’s assertion is it is too
convenient for expanding CO2-EOR operations. In
addition, the multiple bore holes and wells drilled in
them to find and extract oil and gas further increase
the risk of leakage. The IEA also admits that, “[t]
he long-term storage integrity of oil fields that have
been exploited with multiple wells has yet to receive
serious scientific investigation.”108

Odds of CO2 Leakage are
High, and Leakage is Bad

In order for CCS to deliver a lasting benefit to the
climate, the vast majority of sequestered CO2 must
remain underground permanently. Geological forma-
tions proposed are sub-seabed and saline aquifers.
The IEA says that depleted oil and gas reservoirs
would be the most likely candidates for initial storage
operations because of both their geology and
proximity to industrial development.

The prominent Sleipner project, a CCS storage
testing site off the coast of Norway injecting CO2
scrubbed from raw gas after extraction, was found
in 2012 to have many nearby fractures, warranting
increased expense toward surveying the geology of
such sites.109 Some scientists say it’s not a matter
of if the site will leak, it’s just a question of when.110
Researchers devoted to the promise of CCS remain
unconcerned.111

However, undue confidence in understanding of
the geology at Sleipner is not new.112 While offshore
injection may be easier for the public to accept,
deepsea sites will be more difficult to monitor. There
are few studies to ascertain potential effects of
undersea CO2 leakage, but scientists have con-
cluded that it may be detrimental across the ocean
food web.113 CO2 leakage from sequestration could
exacerbate already rising ocean acidification, since
the ocean absorbs about 25% of anthropogenic
CO2 pollution. This is threatening a different type of
planetary disaster altogether.114

With regard to injection into deep-saline aquifers, a
recent MIT study seriously undermines previously
held assumptions about the chemistry of CO2
integration with geology underground. This study
indicates that the majority of injected CO2 could
uncontrollably make its way back to the surface.115 In
addition, researchers at Stanford University argued
that CO2 injection carries a “high probability” of
instigating earthquakes that can “threaten the seal
integrity” of the storage site.116 The $2.7 billion In Salah
project in Algeria was suspended indefinitely in 2011
after CO2 injection led to microseismic events that
fractured the caprock. This occurred after injecting
only 3.8 megatons of CO2 (less than a year of emis-
sions from one average-sized new coal plant).117

Just like the two projects in Norway, the In Salah
project was attempting to sequester CO2 scrubbed
from raw natural gas, which is typically vented at gas
extraction sites.

Thanks to fracking for shale gas, we now also know
that seismic activity is exacerbated by injecting the
wastewater underground. Fracking is likely the reason
why Oklahoma, an area not historically prone to
seismic activity, has become the most earthquake-
prone state on the continent.118 In Oklahoma, like in
other states where fracking is rampant, burning coal
is still the primary source of electricity. Figure 6 and
7 show how fracking and CCS could be mutually
exclusive in terms of geography.

The risk of CO2 leakage is also due to the reputation
of the petroleum industry that does not clean up after
itself. Many wells in oil and gas fields are improperly
sealed or not sealed at all. For example, an investiga-
tion conducted by the Associated Press (AP) in the
wake of the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster found
that oil companies “routinely circumvented” regula-
tions for temporarily abandoned wells. More than
1,000 temporarily abandoned wells in Gulf of Mexico
“lingered in an unfinished condition for more than a
decade.”119 In that same AP investigation, while an
oil company representative insisted that it was in
everyone’s interest to seal wells and to do so properly,
state officials estimated that “tens of thousands
[were] badly sealed, either because they predate[d]
strict regulation or because the operating companies
violated the rules.”120

In March 2013 a Texas company, Denbury
Resources, was fined for a blowout that occurred
during a CO2-EOR operation in Mississippi. So-called
‘downhole communication’ (called ‘frack hits,’ if
resulting from fracking operations) occurs when
underground injection connects with old wells,
proving an escape route for the injected CO2 to
come back up to the surface uncontrollably. In the
Denbury EOR operation so much CO2 came back
up old, poorly-capped wells that local wildlife died
from asphyxiation. More than 12 million oil and gas
wells have been drilled in the United States. More
than 3 million of wells have been abandoned, many of
which may never have been capped at all. Incidentally,
Denbury Resources intends to purchase the CO2
that would be captured by the Kemper project for oil
extraction in the Gulf region.121

Fossil Fuel Industry Doesn’t Mind the Odds

The fossil fuel industry has been actively advocating
to shift responsibility and liability for CO2 sequestra-
tion and monitoring to the public, as they have also
done for virtually any type of liability for their public
health impacts. The oil and gas extraction industry is
exempt from regulations under possibly every federal
environmental law, including the Safe Drinking Water
Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Superfund
law.124 In 2013, EPA decided that CO2 captured for
geological sequestration would be exempt from
hazardous waste regulations under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, although pointing
out industry was already exempt if the CO2 is used to
increase oil extraction.125

Industry also succeeded at transferring liability with
respect to international CCS policy. In the 2011
Durban international climate negotiations, countries
agreed to allow CCS projects to be eligible for
application to the Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM). Under the agreement, industry will be required
to monitor sequestration sites for only twenty years
after credits for sequestration have ceased, even if
injection is still occurring, after which liability for any
leakage is transferred to the host country (to the
public).126 Japan, the UK and Norway have counted
investments in carbon capture in developing countries
toward their climate finance obligations agreed during
the UN climate negotiations, including grants by
Norway for CO2-EOR research in India.127

Carbon Capture Scam  Chapter: 34
CO2 Capture Will Increase the
Environmental Impact of Coal

Carbon capture would do nothing to reduce mercury pollution, and could
even exacerbate it by producing greater amounts of coal ash.

Let’s assume CCS could work as its most idealistic
proponents might argue. Assume it isn’t being
developed for increasing oil extraction, but instead
to sequester the CO2 permanently from the atmo-
sphere. At best, CCS would mitigate some of the
carbon pollution associated with burning coal, but
it would do nothing to address a long list of many
other environmental and public health harms associ-
ated with coal use in the power sector. CCS would
exacerbate many of these harms not just because it
would support continued use of coal, but because
power plants using carbon capture require 20% or
more coal to provide the same amount of electricity.

Using coal for electricity requires mining, washing
and processing, transporting, burning, as well as
disposing of ash – in stark contrast with relying
on the wind and sun for energy. This last section
highlights some of the key ways in which CCS would
magnify coal’s environmental footprint.

Water Use

Coal-fired power plants are the largest users of
freshwater (more than agricultural withdrawal) in the
United States,129 a particular problem for Western
and Midwestern states stricken by longer and more
extreme droughts caused by climate change.130
According to the US Department of Energy (DOE),
both coal and natural gas-fired power plants with
carbon capture would consume far more water, up
to twice as much as non-carbon capture plants.131
Coal plants also release and incredible amount
of heated wastewater, damaging local freshwater
ecosystems..

Air and Water Pollution

Coal combustion remains a major source of many
air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide that causes
acid rain and particulate matter that causes health
impacts such as asthma.132 Coal combustion has
historically been the number one cause of mercury
contamination in US waterways.133 Half of the
navigable lakes and rivers in the United States are
closed to fishing and swimming at any given time,
the majority because of mercury contamination.134
New mercury pollution standards will help, but a

Page 24

significant amount of mercury pollution drifts into the
United States from coal combustion in other countries
such as China.135 Carbon capture would do nothing to
reduce mercury pollution, and could even exacerbate
it by producing greater amounts of coal ash.

In addition, drinking water is contaminated by every
part of the coal waste stream with chemicals and
compounds that cause cancer, birth deformities,
and other health issues.136 This is because the coal
industry’s contribution to pollution in our rivers, lakes,
and seas includes a laundry list of toxic chemicals
and compounds, such as cyanide, arsenic, selenium,
ammonia, sulfur, sulfate, nitrates, nitric acid, tars,
oils, fluorides, chlorides, and other acids and metals,
including sodium, iron, thallium, cadmium, beryllium,
barium, antimony, and lead.137

Toxic Coal Ash

Coal plants using carbon capture will produce more
coal ash because the technology requires power to
operate – 20 to 30% of the coal ash generated per
kilowatt hour would be related to carbon capture.138
After mining waste, coal ash is the largest waste
stream in the country, as it is in other countries like
China.139

Coal ash is laden with other cancer-causing chemi-
cals and heavy metals, and most coal ash produced
in recent decades sits in unlined ‘ponds’ that continu-
ously leach into groundwater.140 Coal ash containment
is so negligent that massive quantities have spilled
on multiple occasions, contaminating rivers and even
wiping out nearby communities.141 In one infamous
case in 2008, 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash slurry
(more than oil spilled from the Exxon Valdez) spilled
from its containment near the TVA Kingston Fossil
Plant in Tennessee, forcing evacuations from the
town.142 While new regulations on non-climate air
pollutants will lead to cleaner air, it also means coal
ash will become more toxic.143

In the United States, coal ash has never been
regulated federally even though the problem crosses
state boundaries, and most states have poor or no
regulations on coal ash.144 The TVA Kingston disaster
prompted EPA to consider regulations in 2009, but
decided six years later to provide a coal ash guidance
in lieu of enforceable standards.145

Public Health and the Economy

Coal has a giant, negative impact on the economy.
For instance, coal transport has traditionally domi-
nated US rail capacity. In the United States, transport-
ing coal has been responsible for a quarter of the
carloads and half of the tonnage carried by train,
although this has fallen in recent years with declining
coal demand.146 Coal trains can spill toxic dust along
their path, can catch fire spontaneously, and generally
get in the way of using railways for public transporta-
tion and transporting other commodities.147 Industry
plans to build new export terminals in the Pacific
Northwest, threatening to increase its already massive
footprint on transportation infrastructure.148

Adding up the monetized life cycle costs of coal used
for electricity, such as health costs from its pollution
and environmental cleanup, comes to as much as
$523 billion per year in the United States on top of
the price of electricity – $308 billion if climate-related
costs are excluded. A 2010 Harvard study assessed
the costs of coal pollution that result from lost work
hours and lowered productivity due to various
health conditions, including mental retardation (from
mercury), cancer, cardiovascular disease, black lung
and other pulmonary diseases, transport fatalities,
asthma, and early death. While the study admitted
the true ecological and health costs are worse, it
concluded that “[a]ccounting for the many external
costs over the life cycle for coal-derived electricity
conservatively doubles to triples the price of coal per
kWh of electricity generated.”149

Carbon Capture Scam  Chapter: 45

Conclusion

Even if we could manage to systematically inject
some quantity of CO2 into the ground for a critical
majority of power plants world-wide, it would greatly
exacerbate other extremely destructive impacts of
mining, processing, transporting, and burning coal.

This report has shown how even the most ambi-
tious plans for CCS would not help avert the worst
impacts of climate change. The IEA CCS roadmap
will one day live in infamy as it continues to support
the diversion of money and political will from real
climate solutions, such as the development of
renewable energy. So too will the EPA rule for new
power plants unless the agency revises the rule to
drop any validation that CCS is a good investment.

The Obama administration seems partly driven
by faith in a technology that was supposed to
sequester pollution from the atmosphere. The bigger
reason, perhaps, is reflected in the mindset com-
municated by agencies across the administration,
whether it comes to the KXL tar sands pipeline,
selling taxpayer-owned coal and oil, or drilling in the
Arctic.

Some CCS supporters claim that oil produced with
CO2 injection is going to get produced somewhere
else anyway, and therefore would actually be ‘green’
oil because it keeps CO2 from a coal plant from en-
tering the atmosphere. Is this “clean coal” for “green
oil”? This sounds confusing because it makes no
sense – for the obvious reason that injected CO2
comes back up the well with the oil.

The Obama administration view appears to be
that fossil fuel projects never contribute to climate
change. Every federal agency has an excuse for
why its okay to support new coal, oil and gas supply
projects. For example:

•  The US State Department analysis concluded
the KXL pipeline won’t contribute additional
carbon pollution – because it means other oil
transport methods won’t be used.150

•  The Bureau of Land Management auctions
off taxpayer-owned coal and discounts any
CO2 created by burning that coal – because
it means coal in some other part of the world
won’t get mined. BLM says the same regarding
gas extraction projects on public land.151

•  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management

zeros out CO2 from burning oil extracted in the
Arctic – because this means Arctic oil will simply
displace oil on the international market.152

•  EPA’s proposed carbon rule reflects this logic
too, by promoting oil production with CO2
injection without accounting for any of the CO2
injected, nor created by burning the oil later.

We hope EPA will rethink its proposed rule and
come up with a final policy that acknowledges fossil
fuel-fired power plants, not to mention fossil fuel
extraction, are not the future of energy investment.
Solar and wind are, as the Greenpeace Energy [R]
evolution analysis has predicted more accurately
than most.153

Human-caused global climate disruption is certainly
a politically difficult problem. Many politicians,
namely climate deniers, have simply chosen to look
away or became willful allies of big climate polluters.
However, many of the rest of our elected decision-
makers desperately search for a climate solution
that will alienate as few of their powerful fossil fuel
constituents as possible. Unfortunately, there is no
viable solution for both supporting the use of fossil
fuels and the climate simultaneously. True climate
leaders have no option but to tackle the damaging
economic entrenchment of the coal, oil and gas
industry. Climate leadership means opposing carbon
capture and storage. Real climate solutions like
building renewables, developing a smarter electric
grid, energy efficiency, and reforestation are already
working, but we need our decisionmakers to help
pick up the pace.

Appendix

Methodology for Calculating ‘Cost
of Avoided Emissions per EIA’
(kilograms per kilowatt hour)

The basis of the calculations is EIA projections for
costs of new energy sources entering service in
2019. This short term projection makes it an estimate
of new sources proposed today, since electricity
generating units (EGUs) can take a few years from
proposal to coming on line. EIA data is using 2012
dollars and megawatt hours (MWh). We used EIA data
that excluded subsidies for system-wide, levelized
cost. Therefore, this cost should include all variable
and fixed costs, including fuel inputs and manage-
ment of outputs like pollution abatement. It includes
maintenance costs and should include the total cost
of necessary infrastructure. This also accounts for
capacity factor of each energy source, which is the
average percentage of time the energy source is
generating at full potential. For example, a coal plant
is assumed to be at full production potential 85% of
the time. On-shore wind capacity factor is 35% and
Solar-PV is 25%. We converted EIA projections for
system-wide, levelized costs into cents per kilowatt
hour (kWh).

We used EIA data also for point-source CO2 emis-
sions factors for various energy sources per kWh.
This is the CO2 created by combustion of the fuel
based on average heat rate of each fuel. EIA data is in
pounds per kwh, which we converted into kilograms
per kwh. We assumed bituminous coal is used. On
average, bituminous coal has about 4.6% fewer
emissions than lignite (brown coal) and 3.7% fewer
emissions than sub-bituminous coal.

For upstream emissions of coal, such as emissions
due to mining and transportation, we used analysis
from Jaramillo, et al. This analysis was assessing
comparative life-cycle emissions of coal with various
types of domestic methane gas used in electricity
production. They relied on a 100-year time horizon
for methane, which is a significant component of
upstream coal emissions related to mining. Given that
avoiding catastrophic climate change requires drastic
climate pollution reductions within the next two

decades, it is better to use the 20-year time horizon in
which case methane is at least three times as potent
a greenhouse gas. Therefore, for this reason alone,
we consider this life cycle emissions estimate to be
very generous in favor of coal.

For the life cycle CO2 emissions of solar, wind
and geothermal, we relied on analysis provided by
Sovacool, et al. CO2 emissions associated with solar,
wind and geothermal are largely due to production of
infrastructure and components.

To calculate the cost per kilogram of avoided CO2,
we first had to choose a baseline for emissions to be
avoided from new energy sources. For this baseline
we referenced the emissions from a coal plant without
carbon capture that is burning bituminous coal.

To calculate total emissions of each energy source,
we added together all the point source emissions
with additional life cycle GHGs, as well as the
emissions associated with additional coal needed to
operate carbon capture (i.e., the energy penalty of
CCS). This energy penalty for CCS we assumed is
20%, although it could be as high as 40%. We also
assumed the coal plant with CO2 capture is the most
modern, efficient integrated gasification combined
cycle technology.

To calculate kilograms of avoided emissions, we
subtracted the total emissions from each energy
source from the emissions of the baseline. For
example, the total emissions of the IGCC plant with
CO2 capture was 0.18956 kilograms per kwh, which
was subtracted from 1.015 kilograms per kwh for the
baseline coal plant, resulting in 0.82544 kilograms of
avoided CO2 pollution.

Finally, for each energy source we divided the total
system-wide cost per kwh by the total for avoided
emissions per kilogram.
