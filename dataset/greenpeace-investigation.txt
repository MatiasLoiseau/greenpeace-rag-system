The Greenpeace evidence shows a systematic, large scale operation
on board the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru, to steal whale meat
processed from the Southern Ocean hunt. It is believed the practise
has been taking place for many years. During the course of the
investigation, Greenpeace obtained a box of stolen whale meat as
proof of the fraud.
The box contained 23.5kgs of whale meat. Known as “Unesu” in
Japanese, the meat is preserved in salt, rather than the ofﬁcial
preserving method of freezing. The box obtained by Greenpeace was
one of four boxes, claimed to be “personal baggage” sent to a home
address via an express delivery company by an employee of KyodoSenpaku who was a crew member on board the Nisshin Maru during
the 2007/2008 Southern Ocean expedition. The value of this one box
is between 100,000 yen (US$1,000) and 300,000 yen (US$3,000 ).Further investigation has established that more than 23 crewmembers sent at least 93 boxes of “personal baggage” to at least 30
destinations.

GreenpeaceInternational Japan’sStolenWhaleMeatScandal 7From the evidence and testimony of this investigation, it appears that
this kind of theft of whale meat, ﬁnanced by tax payers money, hasbeen taking place over many years as an open secret.
When enquiries were made to the Fisheries Agency of Japan, which
has jurisdiction over whale meat distribution, they claimed only
ofﬁcially sanctioned whale meat is ofﬂoaded from the Nisshin Maru.
Given the scale and organised nature of the illegality uncovered by
Greenpeace, it is not credible for ofﬁcials from Kyodo Senpaku, the
Institute of Cetacean Research and even the Fisheries Agency to
deny knowledge of the fraud.Greenpeace will ﬁle a complaint with the T okyo district Public
Prosecutor’ s Ofﬁce. In addition to the complaint, Greenpeacedemands the Government of Japan:

Greenpeace investigation, including photographic and testimonial
evidence of the scale of the stolen whale meat scandal.
Details of the identity of informers and Kyodo Senpaku employees
have been removed from this report, but employee details will besupplied to the T okyo district Public Prosecutors Ofﬁce.

Greenpeace was contacted by an informer who used to be involved
in the whaling operation and claimed to have information about theJapanese government’ s “research whaling” programme.
The credibility of the witness was veriﬁed through secondaryinterviews supporting his claims and Greenpeace’ s own investigation.
There were four allegations:

ThefulltranscriptisavailableinAppendix1
Q: About how many of the people on board, do you think (involved in
this theft)?
A: On the Nisshin Maru, if there’ s 150 crew, it’ s on the order of about
120 or 130, and everyone takes home about 200 or 300 kilos of
whalemeat or bacon. This is meat that doesn’t appear in the
production ﬁgures, you know.
Q: In other words, separate from the formally announced number oftons of whalemeat?
A: Apart, it’ s apart from that. It seems like they’ve been doing this
since a long time ago.
Q: Is this the kind of situation that everyone knows about?
A, Yes. Everyone knows, but it’ s not talked about in public. They all do
it with tacit understanding. There are Kyodo Senpaku staff there too,
but it seems that they see and pretend not to see.
Q: On the Nisshin Maru it’ s not only Kyodo Senpaku but, for example,
there are people from the Institute for Cetacean Research on board,
too, aren’t there?
A:, Yes. Probably they do know, but they don’t talk about it openly.

fact that they are still receiving boxes from current employees

which can take months and is not the ofﬁcial preserving process on
board, adds to the value. At the market, minke whale bacon sells for
about 20,000 yen per kilo.
The whale meat in the box had not been fully processed into unesu,
therefore the actual market value is unclear, but even taking this into
consideration, it is estimated to have a value of between 5,000 and
15,000 yen (US$50 – US$150) per kilo. Therefore one 23.5 kilo box
would be worth between 110,000 and 350,000 yen (US$1,100 –
US$3,500). If all four boxes contained the same amount of meat, the
crewmember could be making a proﬁt of between 440,000 to
1,400,000 yen (US$4,400 – US$14,000)

Before and after the Nisshin Maru returned to T okyo harbour on 15
April, Greenpeace investigators visited whale meat sellers and
restaurants in various locations including Hakodate, Hiroshima,Kushiro, Sapporo, Nagasaki, Nagano, Shimonoseki, Kagoshima, andT okyo, gathering evidence that traders not only know stolen whalemeat is available from the Nisshin Maru crew, but that many wereexpecting supplies of whale meat well in advance of the ofﬁcialrelease of meat in June. Transcripts of secret ﬁlming of traders is
contained in Appendix 1.AtthepressconferenceonApril5th2008,TakahideNaruko,achiefofFarSeasFisheriesDivisionoftheFisheriesAgencyofJapan,saidthatraisingthepriceofthewhalemeatfromthe

couldhuntonly551whalesthisyearfromtheSouthernOcean,60%ofouraim,sinceactivitiesbyanti-whalingorganizationsdisturbedourresearch.”(April15th2008,Asahi-ShinbunWebsite)
Greenpeace Japan telephoned T akahide Naruko on May 8th 2008.Despite the apparent widespread knowledge of the illegal activities onboard the Nisshin Maru factory whaling ship amongst crew, as well as
meat traders who expect to receive the supplies earlier than the
ofﬁcial release date, Mr. Naruko denied that there was any possibility
of crew privately bringing back whale meat from the Southern Oceanwhaling expedition. If it is true that the authorities responsible for
whale meat distribution are not aware of additional meat being soldearlier than the ofﬁcial release dates, then this raises serious
questions about the competence of the Fisheries Agency and the Far
Seas Fisheries Division, to manage the whaling programme and the
subsequent meat sales.
A full transcipt of the recorded conversation is in Appendix 1.

The demand for whale meat is now so low that the operation is
commercially unsustainable – a fact made clear by the revelation that
the Institute of Cetacean Research has been unable to repay the 1billion yen (approximately 10 million US dollars) government loan from2006.
The Japanese taxpayer should no longer be expected to fund a failed
and corrupt whaling programme in the Southern Ocean.

24GreenpeaceInternational Japan’sStolenWhaleMeatScandalGREENPEACEINFORMER
Q: First of all, to start with, it’ s ﬁne to say as much or as little as you like,
but could you please let us know how it is that you knew about the
details that you’ve given to us as evidence at this time, and the reason
why you gave it to us now. .
A: It’ s because I was actually with Kyodo Senpaku, whaling in the
Southern Ocean, sailing on the research programme. If you ask why I
wanted to talk about it, the reality is that a considerable quantity of
whalemeat was being discarded under the name of research. I had
some doubt about whether this maybe wasn’t research, you know, and
felt that this wasn’t good, and started wanting to talk about it.
Q: In what way speciﬁcally was the discarding of the whalemeat
being done?
A: As there was a period when we couldn’t catch due to Greenpeace
and Sea Shepherd’ s obstruction actions, the situation was that we had
to quickly catch in a hurry, and there were many times when we had to
catch at least 20 minke in a day. At those times mostly, when there
were at least twenty whales, it was ‘miscellaneous meat.’ We couldn’t
handle all this smaller parts of meat and other miscellaneous meat and
it would be left there as it was until the next day. At 7.00am, the next
new whale would come on board. Next, we couldn’t ﬁnish processingand the whole lot would just be discarded. From one minke there is
about 350 kilos of miscellaneous meat, so by a rough calculation it
would seem about seven tons was thrown away.
Q: That means almost on a daily basis about seven tons of meat was
being discarded?
A: That’ s right. When twenty or more whales came on board, without a
doubt they discarded meat.
Q: That means, without any processing they discard it just like that?
A: That’ s right. Without touching it. They discard it because there’ s no
time to process it.
Q: How did the ship’ s crew who saw this feel about it?
A: A lot of people were saying don’t catch them if it’ s just going to be
discarded, but it wasn’t something that could be complained to the
bosses, you know. It was a private matter. They were saying don’t take
them if it’ s so many that they’re discarded.
Q: I expect for the people who caught the whales, the fact that they
were discarded…
A: They really hated that. It was a very disagreeable thing for the people
who have been involved a long time with whales.Q: So what they’re doing is quite pointless?
A: Yes, it’ s not research whaling, it seems like it’ s commercial whaling.
Q: So they take just the part they need and discard the remainder?
A: Yes, that’ s right. It seemed they were working with the idea that
they’ll discard it without touching it.
Q: In some places, it’ s been said that the random catching wasn’t being
done. What do you think about that?
A: It seemed like whenever they could catch a whale, they caught it.
Most of the time when they couldn’t, it was when the sea was rough.
The impression is that when whales could be caught, they would catch
any number.
Q: So you deﬁnitely didn’t have the sense that they were catching
randomly, but taking them wherever they were, whenever they were
there.
A: That’ s right.
Q: Beside this, do you know of other matters in which the
crewmembers were doing wrongful things?
A: Well, I think this is probably a traditional thing, but most of the crew
preserve whalemeat in salt themselves, such as Unesu for whale
bacon, and take it home. This is a fair quantity, with so many people
taking some. It’ s not every crewmember, though. The young people
don’t have much interest. All the people of a certain age are taking it
home.
Q: Speciﬁcally, the older crewmembers are people connected with what
kind of employment?
A: Mostly production, they’re production workers. It’ s production
workers mostly.
Q: About how many of the people on board, do you think?
A: On the Nisshin Maru, if there’ s 150 crew, it’ s on the order of about
120 or 130, and everyone takes home about 200 or 300 kilos of
whalemeat or bacon. This is meat that doesn’t appear in the production
ﬁgures, you know.APPENDIXONE:TRANSCRIPTSOF
TESTIMONYANDINTERVIEWS

GreenpeaceInternational Japan’sStolenWhaleMeatScandal 25Q: In other words, separate from the formally announced number of
tons of whalemeat?
A: Apart, it’ s apart from that. It seems like they’ve been doing this since
a long time ago.
Q, Is this the kind of situation that everyone knows about?
A: Yes. Everyone knows, but it’ s not talked about in public. They all do it
with tacit understanding. There are Kyodo Senpaku staff there too, but
it seems that they see and pretend not to see.
Q: On the Nisshin Maru it’ s not only Kyodo Senpaku but, for example,
there are people from the Institute for Cetacean Research on board,
too, aren’t there?
A: Yes. Probably they do know, but they don’t talk about it openly. T o
some extent everyone is being fair and square in this way, they aren’t
doing something like stealing in front of people’ s eyes. Each person is
doing it in a hidden way. But everybody knows. But they aren’t doing
anything to pursue the matter boldly.
Q: How exactly are they doing this as you say “in a hidden way”?
A: For example, if it’ s unesu, it’ s made into bacon, and each person
pickles it in salt to preserve it in their own cabin. For the rest of the
meat, cuts like red meat and tail meat are preserved by freezing.
Everyone has their own coldstore, and in there is a place for preserving.
Q: So this means they are preserving something taken improperly?
A: That’ s right. Yes.
Q: In what kind of form does everyone put it in?
A: They pack it in boxes. Frozen goods are already packed in boxes,
and everything is packed in boxes.
Q: So they put this there under an implicit understanding?
A: That’ s right. It’ s known that it exists, and none of the people
responsible say anything. None of the the Kyodo Senpaku employees
say anything. The Institute people almost never go in there,
Q: Do you know what quanity is taken home by the people who take
the most, for example?
A: Yes. The biggest packing case for home delivery service can
generally hold about 40 kilos, and there are people who take about 20
boxes. So that’ s 800 kilos. About that much, for people who take the
most.Q: What about the least?
A: They take about ﬁve or six boxes.
Q: Would there be, for example, whales like ﬁn whales included in that?
A: Yes. When I was on board we were taking ﬁn whales, and ﬁn whale
is perfect, so red meat and unesu from ﬁn whales was included.
However, not entirely. I think most of that was grabbed and packed by
upper management and other superiors.
Q: As for this whalemeat which is hidden and taken home, is a lot of it
high value?
A: High value product, yes. All of it.
Q: So this means they don’t steal the inexpensive cuts?
A: Right. 80% is unesu. The raw material for bacon, you know.
Q: Is there anything besides that?
A: There’ s red meat, and fatty red meat, and tail meat too.
Q: Is this hiding and taking meat home done for no particular reason,
simply to hide it and take it home?
A: If it was just to eat at home, they wouldn’t need that kind of quantity.
Therefore, well, the impression is that people who have been crew for
ten or 20 years are selling it on a wide scale in their home towns and at
markets in the area.
Q: What kind of tangible form does that take, is there evidence for this
selling on a large scale that one hears of, is there anything like that?
A: I heard it from people on the ships’ crew. There was even one who
said he’d sold enough, just with bacon, to build a house.
Q: Earlier, you mentioned that people from the Japan Institute for
Cetacean Research knew about this to some extent, but to what extent
do you think everyone was awarre of it?
A: They weren’t looking to catch people red-handed but knew it was
going on, and mostly said nothing.

14:14:06
Researcher: Do you have something like a delicious tasting salt,
maybe a good salt to spread over ﬁsh and preserve it? Are there
different kinds?
Woman: No, because even for something like whale, ordinary salt is
used. The preserving of the skin in salt is done with salt coming from
here. Coarse sea salt is good. If it’ s a carefully selected part, the type
of salt makes no difference.
14:14:50
Researcher: Where is the whale coming from?
Woman: You hear it a lot, don’t you, like Kyoko Senpaku or Nisshin
Maru. They bring it back pickled in salt, or frozen. The research
whaling has been treated badly recently hasn’t it? They’re coming
back on the 29th. Coming into the Universal shipbuilding dock. We’re
doing that sort of work.

29th. Because then that sushi shop [and] people from restaurants
around this area buy it.
Researcher: Oh, they buy it from the ship?Woman: No, not from the ship but I don’t know what the route is.
17:12:10Researcher:There’ s frozen whale and there’ s salt-pickled whale. So is
it that you’re selling your salt to Kyodo Senpaku?
Woman: Uh-huh.WHALEMEATTRADERS

(After visiting the recommended sushi shop)
Researcher: It wasn’t written on the menu.
Man: Yeah, it’ s not.
Researcher: If you’re in the know, you’re in the know?
Man: (Nods)Researcher: Is there a special name?
Man: I don’t think so. This year’ s whale isn’t here yet. From the 29th
onwards.Researcher: If so, I’ll go then. Is it this sort of feeling every year? When
the ship arrives…
Man: Some people have them, somehow…

Researcher: I’ve come today having been referred by Mr. XX. I’d like
to eat whale.
Man: Yes?
Researcher: Do you have this year’ s new stock?
Man: We do have some, but haven’t cut the seal yet.
19:27:30
Researcher: When will you be opening this year’ s?Man: It’ s been busy, you know. Ha ha ha.
Researcher: So it’ s that you’re in the process of stocking up?
Man: That’ s right.Researcher: I’m in Hiroshima til the end of the month, will it be in
time?
Man: Hmm, well.Researcher: Is there enough time?Man: (makes afﬁmative gesture)
Researcher: Well then, I’ll come again around the end of the month.

Researcher: Is the meat I’ve asked for today from the Southern
Ocean? Did it come this year?Man: (makes afﬁrmative motion)
17:34:19Researcher: Quite valuable, this, isn’t it? Special route… new meat
from the Southern Ocean, I humbly partake. Which part is it from?
Man: That’ s a secret. The very best is meat from the tail, but it’ s so
much so that it’ s practically impossible to get if you don’t live in
Nagatacho.
17:47:35
Researcher: Crewmembers take whalemeat for their own use. In
secret?Man: That’ s right. Those who have recently joined get red meat, and
it’ s allocated by seniority of service. Of course the good parts, well it’ s
the same with everything, but there’ s a thing called ﬁshermen’ s
cuisine.
17:49:00
Man: The delicious parts don’t appear in the market. They choose the
best parts themselves when they do the ﬂensing.
Researcher: What I’ve had just now, has it come by that route?
Man: No, no, that comes a different way.
17:51:35Researcher: By a different route, there’ s a route for obtaining this
year’ s meat?Man: (nods)

GreenpeaceInternational Japan’sStolenWhaleMeatScandal 29Researcher: The high value part?
Man: (nods) If you pay a bit of money you can get it. On the boat, it’ s
classiﬁed by regions of the country. It’ s cut precisely and comes out
as sashimi product.
18:00:40
Researcher: Are the crew selling what they’ve secretly brought back?
Man: That kind of thing doesn’t happen much. Mostly it’ s friends and
relatives and the like. A few years ago there was a crewmember who
said ”I gave some to that snack [bar?]”
18:12:30
Researcher: About how much, by weight, of this meat is being
brought in?
Man: (silence)+ Sometimes there’ s talk about frozen blocks coming
from Kyushu.
The whalemeat that’ s just arrived hasn’t gone round anywhere yet.
18:23:10
Researcher: The specially valuable meat I had just now…
Man: Somewhere, there will be some place where that is.
18:25:45Researcher: Is this meat from this year?
Man: (nods yes)8May2008
11:58
Investigator: After the price (of the whale meat) will be decided on
June, will all whale meat be sold at this price?
Mr. Naruko: Yes, United price will be set according to each part of the
meat. Meat will go to the wholesalers with this price.
Investigator: Which means there will be no sales before June?
Mr. Naruko: Yes, without a price, there’ s no way to sell.
Investigator: I heard from somewhere that the sailors used to bring
back some whale meat as private souvenirs during the industrialwhaling period. This does not happen these days under the researchwhaling, right?
Mr. Naruko: Of course not. Since the distribution (of whale meat) is
very limited.
Investigator: Since the whale meat is considered as “ofﬁcial,” right?
Mr. Naruko: Yes.
