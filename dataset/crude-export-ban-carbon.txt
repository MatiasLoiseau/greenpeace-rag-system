A growing body of research has shown 
that continued investment in fossil fuel 
extraction will put global climate goals 
out of reach.1,2 The contradiction between 
a climate-safe emissions trajectory and 
increasing fossil fuel production is most 
stark in the United States, which the shale 
boom has made the world’s leading oil and 
gas producer.3 One key factor in triggering 
this boom was the 2015 removal of the 
decades-old ban on crude oil exports. 
As Jim Teague, the chief executive of 
Enterprise Products, the U.S.’s largest crude 
exporter, told The Dallas Morning News  
in November 2019, “Without the crude oil 
export ban repeal, the United States would 
not be producing half of the oil it is today 
because it could not be exported.”4
The surge of oil and gas production in 
recent years has placed the planet at great 
risk, and policymakers must act swiftly to 
rein in expansion and bring sanity to U.S. 
energy policy.
The next president and Congress must 
reinstate the crude oil export ban as one 
part of a suite of ambitious Green New Deal 
policies to phase out fossil fuel production, 
ensure justice and equity for workers 
and communities, and transform the U.S. 
economy. Restoring the ban would not be a new step for the federal government — 
to the contrary, export restrictions were 
the norm for decades — but rather an 
admission that removing the ban in 2015 
was an error that has deepened the climate 
crisis and made the needed transformation 
of the U.S. energy system significantly  
more difficult. 
In this briefing, we find that reinstating the 
U.S. crude oil export ban could lead to 
reductions in global carbon emissions by 
as much as 73 to 165 million metric tons 
of CO2-equivalent each year.  Reinstating 
the ban would also send a strong signal to 
energy investors that the fossil fuel era is 
drawing to a close, act as a failsafe against 
future export-directed investments and 
carbon leakage, and provide a useful policy 
lever over emissions beyond U.S. borders.
This range of carbon emissions reductions 
is the equivalent of closing between 19 
and 42 coal plants, and delivers a carbon 
benefit comparable to implementing 
President Barack Obama’s proposed 
light-duty vehicle efficiency standards.  
This range of carbon reductions arises from 
considering a range of plausible scenarios, 
although the uncertainty in some key 
parameters is large and the carbon benefit 
could be larger or smaller.Crucially, ambitious policies to constrain 
and phase out fossil fuel production must 
be carried out in tandem with strong just 
transition policies to ensure that the lives 
and livelihoods of industry workers and 
communities are protected and improved 
throughout the transition. 
The next president has the legal authority 
to reinstate crude oil export restrictions by 
declaring a national climate emergency, but 
ultimately, Congress must act to incorporate 
export restrictions as an essential part 
of U.S. energy policy for the twenty-
first century. The speed and scale of the 
climate crisis demands bold action from 
policymakers, who must respond with all 
available policy tools.1. SUMMARY
The sun sets behind a drilling rig at a hydrofracking installation near Westhoff in DeWitt 
County. The shale oil boom is going strong south of San Antonio on a formation that 
stretches for about 300 miles across south Texas, one of the most prolific oil patches 
in the United States. Flaring of excess gas in drilling for oil is also a byproduct that’s 
vented into the atmosphere releasing all sorts of volatile organic chemicals, causing air 
pollution and releasing climate changing methane gas. ©Les Stone/Greenpeace

America’s crude oil export restrictions were 
initially legislated in response to the Arab Oil 
Embargo of October 1973. The oil embargo 
was itself a response to the U.S. arming of 
Israel following attacks by Syria and Egypt 
during the Yom Kippur War, and while it 
only lasted six months, its impact triggered 
a U.S. oil policy framework that would last 
over 40 years. 
The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 was 
amended in November 1973 to restrict 
crude oil exports, stipulating that export 
licenses can only be granted under certain 
conditions, including if the president 
provides evidence to Congress that 
exporting crude oil would not diminish the 
quantity or quality of U.S. oil supply.5
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
(EPCA) of 1975 cemented these restrictions 
within a broader energy policy clearly 
focused on energy conservation and 
security.6 The EPCA gave the president 
authority to restrict crude oil exports as 
well as other energy commodities, and to 
allow exemptions “which he determines to 
be consistent with the national interest and 
the purposes of this Act.”7 Other key oil-
related provisions in the EPCA included the 
creation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
and the vehicle fuel efficiency program 
known as CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel 
Efficiency).
As a result of the EPCA and subsequent 
amendments to existing legislation 
including the Outer Continental Shelf 
Lands Act and Naval Petroleum Reserves 
Production Act, by the late 1970s the U.S. 
allowed for crude oil exports only under a 
few limited circumstances:f Exports of Californian heavy oil (20° 
API gravity or less), up to an average of 
25,000 barrels per day (bpd);
f Exports to Canada if the oil is refined or 
consumed within Canada;
f Exports of oil sourced from the Cook 
Inlet in Alaska;
f Exports to Canada of oil sourced from 
Alaska’s North Slope and transported 
over the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, up to an 
average of 50,000 bpd;
f Exports of oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve if an equivalent 
amount of refined product is exchanged 
in return;
f Exports of foreign crude oil if 
documentation is provided showing it 
has not been commingled with domestic 
oil during its transit through the United 
States.
THE HISTORY OF CRUDE OIL 
EXPORTS
As a result of these exemptions, some crude 
oil was exported during the late 1970s, 
1980s, and 1990s, primarily from Alaska. 
Because Alaska was so distant from key U.S. 
refining markets other than the west coast, 
limited exports were allowed to prevent 
large discounts on Alaskan oil prices. 
Data from the U.S. Energy Information 
Agency (EIA) does not detail exports by 
destination until 1993, but the limited data 
available suggest that the U.S. Virgin Islands 
were a major destination for Alaskan crude 
oil until around 1995, when restrictions were further lifted on North Slope crude 
oil.8 Following this, Asia became a prime 
destination until around 2000, when 
declining Alaskan oil production reduced 
exports significantly. Some of the crude 
exported in this period may have been 
foreign crude that was imported to the 
United States and re-exported.9
These limited exports averaged around 
150,000 bpd from the late 1970s to late 
1990s, before dropping dramatically in the 
2000s (Figure 1). During this time period, 
U.S. oil production averaged over 7.8 
million bpd; therefore, under 2 percent of 
U.S. crude was exported. By contrast, 2019 
figures through October show an average 
of 2.9 million bpd exported, which is around 
24 percent of 2019 oil production.
After 2010, and accelerating after 2012, the 
shale oil boom led to a resurgence of U.S. 
production, and of the still limited crude 
exports facilitated through exemptions 
to the crude export ban. In 2013, exports 
surpassed 100,000 bpd for the first time 
since 1999. 2014 saw a dramatic jump to 
350,000 bpd, the highest level on record. 
2015 was the last year of export restrictions, 
as the ban was lifted in mid-December 
2015. Exports reached 465,000 bpd on 
average, representing 4.75 percent of U.S. 
production that year.
Over 90 percent of this crude was exported 
to Canada, which was permissible under 
the existing regulations. Limited exports to 
other countries were the result of occasional 
shipments of condensate — an ultra-light 
liquid sometimes categorized with gas and 
sometimes with oil — licensed by the U.S. 
Bureau of Industry and Security.a
a Condensate is an ultra-light liquid that exists as gas in the reservoir and condenses to a liquid at surface temperature and pressure. The EIA includes condensate in its crude oil 
statistics if the condensate is produced in the field rather than in a gas processing plant. Condensate is abundant in U.S. shale plays, particularly in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas. 
Applications to export condensate to countries other than Canada was one of the first signs of the oil industry testing the limits of the crude export regulations.2. AMERICA’S CRUDE 
OIL EXPORT BAN
4

Exports to Canada primarily traveled by 
rail from North Dakota, with some Eagle 
Ford crude traveling by ship from Corpus 
Christi, Texas, to refineries on the east 
coast of Canada.10 Since the crude export 
ban was lifted in 2015, exports to Canada 
have remained at roughly the same levels, 
indicating that Canadian demand for U.S. oil 
Canada was largely being met prior to the 
ban being lifted.11
LIFTING THE EXPORT BAN:  
THE OIL LOBBYISTS 
DESCEND ON WASHINGTON
In 2013, oil producers began a major 
lobbying effort to overturn the crude oil 
export regulations. This push was initially 
led by Exxon12 and the American Petroleum 
Institute.13 Former Congressman Joe Barton, 
a Republican from Texas who became 
the key driver of legislation to repeal the 
ban, recalled his being approached by 
ConocoPhillips lobbyists in early 2014. “I 
opposed the idea, because I thought we 
should keep our oil in the U.S. But then 
I heard from Scott Sheffield, the chief 
executive of Pioneer Natural Resources. 
Pioneer was a major producer in the 
Permian, and if the crude oil export ban 
was not lifted, he said, Pioneer’s future was 
cloudy.”14Barton became convinced to introduce 
legislation to lift the export ban following 
industry arguments that growing U.S. 
production would soon outgrow its 
available uses at the time. “Both Conoco 
and Pioneer pointed out that there wasn’t a 
market for our growing domestic shale oil 
production, because our U.S. refineries were 
set up to process the heavier foreign oils.”15
U.S. shale oil is overwhelmingly light sweet 
crude, meaning it is low-density and has 
a low sulfur content. For much of the 
decade prior to the emergence of the shale 
boom, many U.S. refiners had optimized 
their refineries to process heavy sour 
crude.16,17 This low-quality crude is abundant 
primarily in Mexico, Venezuela, and Canada. 
During the 2000s, U.S. refiners believed 
secure sources of light sweet oil were in 
decline, and future production growth was 
anticipated to come primarily from sources 
of heavy oil, particularly the Canadian tar 
sands. Processing these heavier, more 
difficult-to-refine crude varieties meant 
refiners could profit from converting this 
cheap, low-quality feedstock into more 
valuable refined products, but it required 
large capital investments in specialized 
refining equipment. In America’s largest 
refining centers, particularly on the Gulf Coast and in the Midwest, billions of dollars 
were spent reconfiguring refineries to 
process cheap, imported heavy sour crude.18
As domestic production of light oil boomed 
in the early 2010s, refiners found ways 
to increase domestic light oil processing, 
but soon ran up against limits. Producers 
feared a light oil refining wall would be hit 
imminently, leading to a stagnation and 
cessation of production growth. 
Following two years of intensive lobbying 
on Capitol Hill, a clause to repeal Section 
103 of the EPCA and remove all crude 
oil export restrictions was inserted into a 
must-pass consolidated appropriations 
bill, which passed on December 18, 
2015. However, presidential authority to 
reinstate restrictions was maintained, in the 
case of sanctions, national security, or a 
presidentially declared national emergency.19 Figure 1: U.S. Crude Oil Exports, 1970-2019

750% Growth: Ban Lifted, Exports 
and Production Surge
While it is unclear exactly how U.S. refiners 
would have reacted to increasing light oil 
production had the export ban not been 
lifted, since restrictions were removed, 
virtually all U.S. production growth has gone 
to export. 
Since December 2015, exports have grown 
over 750 percent, from roughly 400,000 
bpd in 2015 to 3.4 million bpd in October 
2019, the latest month of available figures.20 
This is an all-time monthly high, a record 
currently being broken every few months. 
Notably, this monthly average of 3.4 million 
bpd corresponds exactly to production 
growth from December 2015, when the ban 
was lifted, to October 2019.21
Exports in the ten months to October 2019 
averaged over 2.9 million bpd. On an annual 
average basis, export growth from 2015 to 
2019 of over 2.4 million bpd is 91 percent of 
production growth in the same period.b 
Figure 2 shows that initial export growth 
was slow. This was likely due to a slight 
decline in U.S. production in 2016, which 
was itself the result of an oil price decline following a November 2014 decision by  
the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to end 
production quotas. In 2017 U.S. production 
growth resumed, and exports followed suit and have grown steadily ever since. 
Prior to the export ban being lifted, about 
4.75 percent of U.S. production was being 
exported. In 2019, that figure was 24 
percent and rising.

Domestic Light Oil Refining Has 
Likely Reached Its Limits; Exports 
May Double by 2024
Analysis from U.S. oil and gas industry 
experts RBN Energy suggests that U.S. 
refiners likely hit a limit to light oil refining in 
the past few years, and are unlikely to add 
significant refining capacity. RBN projects 
that exports will rise to nearly 6 million 
bpd by 2024 to accommodate projected 
production growth, a near doubling of 
current figures.22 
The left chart in Figure 3 shows RBN 
Energy’s analysis of the projected U.S. 
heavy and light crude oil balance. The 
columns show both imports and domestic 
production for heavy and light oil, while the 
red line is the average annual throughput of 
all crude at U.S. refineries, a statistic known 
as refinery runs. The chart shows that 
there has been very little change in heavy 
oil refining since 2015, and RBN expects 
current heavy crude imports of around 6.5 
million bpd to remain constant to at least 
2024, continuing to feed the heavy crude-
optimized refineries discussed above.
The red line shows a slight increase in 
refinery throughput up to 2018. According to RBN, this came partly from capacity 
increases and partly from higher utilization 
of existing capacity. The small 2019 decline 
in refinery runs is primarily due to the 
closure of the East Coast’s largest refinery 
in Philadelphia following an explosion and 
fire in June 2019. 
The most dramatic change comes from 
increasing domestic light oil production, 
which is shown overtaking refinery runs from 
2017 onwards. RBN projects an additional 
3.7 million bpd of light oil production by 
2024, while refinery runs are expected to 
increase by only 0.35 million bpd. As RBN’s 
John Zanner states, “(t)hat light shale oil 
in the portion of the blue bars above the 
red line effectively has no home in the U.S. 
market.”23 Consequently, as the chart on the 
right shows, exports are projected to rise to 
5.9 million bpd. the EIA’s High Oil and Gas case, suggests 
that production could reach over 18.9 
million bpd by 2032.25 This would be over 
50 percent growth from 2019 levels, and 
is predicated on the continued absence 
of climate policies or other regulation 
to constrain U.S. oil production. As RBN 
Energy’s analysis clearly shows, all of 
this production growth would likely be 
exported. If it cannot be exported, then  
it is highly unlikely that so much oil will  
be produced. 
As Jim Teague, the chief executive of 
Enterprise Products, the U.S.’s largest crude 
exporter, told The Dallas Morning News in 
November 2019, “Without the crude oil 
export ban repeal, the United States would 
not be producing half of the oil it is today 
because it could not be exported.”26
This briefing uses a simple model of global 
oil supply to estimate the emissions impact 
of reinstating the U.S. crude oil export ban. 
It shows how reimplementing the ban could 
be a powerful tool within a suite of options 
to bring the United States in line with the 
urgent imperative to address the climate 
crisis.

Growth
As this briefing’s main analysis will show, 
oil production growth lowers global oil 
prices, stimulates oil demand, and leads 
to higher global carbon dioxide emissions.

We find that reinstating the U.S. crude 
export ban could reduce global CO2 
emissions by as much as 73 to 165 million 
metric tons of CO2-eq each year — the 
equivalent of the yearly emissions from 19 
to 42 coal-fired power plants.27 This section 
presents the results of a simple model 
and discusses the method used, while full 
calculation details can be found in the 
Appendix.c
To estimate this emissions reduction, we 
follow the approach outlined in Jason 
Bordoff and Trevor Houser’s 2015 study, 
Navigating the US Oil Export Debate .28,29 
They found that a lack of access to 
international markets would impose a 
discount on U.S. crude compared with 
the global price of oil, thereby reducing 
domestic production from the level it might 
achieve without the export restrictions. 
Bordoff and Houser estimated that lifting 
the export ban would cause U.S. crude 
production to increase by 0 to 1.2 million 
bpd over and above the trend that would 
otherwise have occurred. In the absence of 
export restrictions, the studies reviewed by 
that report forecast domestic production 
rising 11 to 14 million bpd by 202030 — 
which is consistent with the high levels of 
domestic production and exports seen 
in recent years following the lifting of the 
crude export ban. Despite the complex 
and constantly changing landscape of the 
global oil industry, the method used by 
Bordoff and Houser remains a useful tool 
for understanding the impact of export 
restrictions.
The key parameter in estimating an export 
ban’s impact is the price discount that would be imposed on domestic crude 
oil. This discount would arise principally 
because U.S. refiners are configured to 
accept heavier grades of crude imported 
from Canada, Venezuela, and other 
regions, as discussed above. In the event 
of an export ban, U.S. refiners would need 
significant time and costly upgrades to 
switch their operations to accommodate the 
light, sweet crude produced by domestic 
shale producers.31
The discount parameter is an estimate of 
the per-barrel cost of the capital upgrades 
needed to allow U.S. refineries to handle 
increased volumes of domestic shale 
oil. If the discount were zero U.S. dollars 
per barrel (bbl), domestic refiners could 
respond to an export ban by simply 
switching from imported crude to domestic 
crude. In that case, domestic production 
would remain unchanged and gross crude 
imports would be reduced. However, 
this level of flexibility from U.S. refiners is 
unlikely.
Bordoff and Houser reviewed a number of 
studies assuming discounts ranging from 
$2 per bbl to $27 per bbl32 and solicited 
a refinery consultant “to assess the cost 
and scale of refinery capacity additions” 
that would be necessary to absorb higher 
levels of domestic crude production. 
They concluded that a discount of $10 
per bbl was a reasonable value for the 
impact of export restrictions. We adopt 
this same value on the assumption that 
domestic refinery economics remain 
relatively unchanged since that analysis. 
The continued high level of gross crude 
imports indicates that U.S. refiners have 
largely not opted to retool their operations in the years since the ban was lifted, despite 
large quantities of available domestic crude, 
meaning that the discount would still apply 
were the crude export ban to be reinstated.33
If domestic crude can only be sold at a 
discount to the global oil price, domestic 
production would decrease by an amount 
that depends on the discount parameter 
and the price elasticity of domestic supply.d 
This cut in domestic production would 
represent a shift in the U.S. and global 
supply curves, leading to a new equilibrium 
at a higher global oil price and a lower level 
of global oil consumption. 
Due to uncertainty in how oil markets 
will evolve in future years and how they 
would react to a reinstated export ban, we 
consider several scenarios. Table 1 shows 
the parameters used for each scenario, 
chosen to show a plausible range of 
impacts. Following Bordoff and Houser, 
we consider a range of discounts from $0 
per bbl to $10 per bbl, and price elasticities 
of supply ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. We use 
three scenarios for domestic production 
levels and global oil prices: the Reference 
Case and the High Oil and Gas Resource 
and Technology (HOG) Case from the EIA’s 
Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2019,34 as 
well as the Rystad Energy UCube Base 
Case.35
Using these parameters, we find that a $10 
per bbl discount would reduce domestic 
production by 1.7 million bpd in the 
Reference Case, 2.1 million bpd in the HOG 
Case, and 2.7 million bpd in the Rystad 
Base Case. Given the estimated decrease in 
U.S. production due to the export ban, we 
can then calculate the change in global oil

Endowment’s Oil Climate Index.e Table 
2 shows the changes in U.S. production, 
global consumption, and annual global 
emissions for the scenarios considered.
We also consider the possibility that U.S. 
shale production supply might be more 
elastic than conventional oil production 
around the globe,38 and consider scenarios 
where the global and U.S. elasticities are 
allowed to differ (the “split” scenarios in 
the bottom 3 rows of Tables 1 and 2). At 
the price levels analyzed (roughly $60 per 
bbl to $80 per bbl), the global elasticity consumption. The new global equilibrium 
point is determined by the price elasticities 
of supply and demand.36,37 Assuming price 
elasticities of demand (-0.3) and supply 
(1.0), we find that each barrel of decrease 
in global oil supply leads to a 0.23 barrel 
decrease in global oil consumption. This 
translates to a decrease in global crude 
consumption ranging from 0.39 to 0.62 
million bpd for the cases considered. 
Finally, the change in carbon emissions due 
to this decline in global oil consumption 
is found by multiplying the change by 
the emissions from consuming a barrel of 
crude oil. For this briefing, we use lifecycle 
e This represents lifecycle emissions from the median U.S. crude oil (U.S. East Texas Field) analyzed by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Oil Climate Index. http://
oci.carnegieendowment.org/   Note that due to much higher rates of gas flaring currently occurring in the Permian Basin, the key source of U.S. oil production growth and the basin 
most directly linked to oil export infrastructure, this emissions rate is likely to be conservative. See Tabuchi, H. 2019. “Despite Their Promises, Giant Energy Companies Burn Away 
Vast Amounts of Natural Gas.” New York Times, October 16. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/climate/natural-gas-flaring-exxon-bp.html  ; Carter, L. & T. Donaghy. 2019. “Exxon 
and BP among worst for flaring in US oil fields despite green pledges.” Unearthed, October 17. https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2019/10/17/exxon-bp-flaring-united-states-

f Emissions leakage occurs when “sources outside the scope of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction system increase emissions as a result of that system,” and it can arise 
through shifts in production, shifts in investment, or price signals. Siikamäki et al. 2012. ‘Climate Policy, International Trade, and Emissions Leakage.’ Resources for the Future. https://
www.rff.org/publications/issue-briefs/climate-policy-international-trade-and-emissions-leakage/of supply is roughly 0.8 to 0.4,39 which 
corresponds to a larger impact on global 
consumption, of 0.27 to 0.43 barrels less 
consumption for each barrel of reduced 
supply. This results in a larger carbon 
impact from reinstating the crude export 
ban, of 136 to 165 million metric tons (Mt) of 
CO2-eq per year for these “split” scenarios.
The annual emissions reductions shown 
in Table 2 are the equivalent of 19 to 42 
coal plants, or 15 to 35 million passenger 
vehicles driven for one year.40 The long-term 
cumulative impact of reinstated export 
restrictions would depend on the details 
of how the policy is implemented, as well Table 1: Range of Parameters for Export Ban Scenarios

as other oil market trends. As a point of 
comparison, if President Barack Obama’s 
proposed light-duty vehicle standards had 
been fully implemented, the regulations 
could have led to annual emissions 
reductions of 27 Mt CO2-eq in 2020, rising 
to 271 Mt CO2-eq by 2030.41 It is unclear 
whether these estimates account for carbon 
leakage, making exact comparisons with 
export restrictions difficult.f
Given the complexity of the global oil 
market and the large uncertainties in 
its evolution over the next decade, the 
scenarios and parameters considered here 
are only meant to provide a representative 
picture of how surging U.S. oil production 
is undermining our climate goals — and 
how renewed export restrictions could play a crucial part in meeting those goals. The 
ultimate impact of a reinstated export ban 
could be smaller than the values presented 
here, for example, if OPEC responds to the 
ban by increasing oil production to keep 
global supply constant, or if U.S. refineries 
are more able to adapt and their response is 
better described by a smaller discount. 
Conversely, the impact of a crude export 
ban could be significantly larger than 
estimated here if discounts greater than $10 
per bbl are considered, or if reinstating the 
ban prevents new investments in pipelines 
and other infrastructure that would help 
facilitate higher levels of production. This 
potential scenario is particularly relevant to 
the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, 
which is projected to provide the majority of planned U.S. oil production growth over the 
next decade, primarily intended for export.42 
Relatedly, if the U.S. successfully adopts 
ambitious climate policies that result in 
declining domestic demand for oil — such as 
a Green New Deal or equivalent policy suite 
— an export ban would play a crucial role 
in preventing surplus domestic production 
from being exported, thereby reducing 
carbon leakage that would otherwise 
undermine domestic emissions reductions.43 
The political impact of reinstating the crude 
export ban in creating space for additional 
bans on fossil fuel exports could also be 
substantial and lead to significant future 
emissions reductions.

Reinstating the crude export ban could 
drive significant emissions reductions, but 
it could also impact labor markets and 
existing jobs in the oil refining, processing, 
and export industries. A reimplementation 
of the ban would therefore require an 
ambitious and well-funded energy policy to 
prioritize justice and equity for workers and 
frontline and Indigenous communities in the 
necessary transition away from fossil fuels. A 
well-managed just transitiong must address 
the particular needs of workers currently 
and formerly employed in the fossil fuel 
sector whose lives — as well those of their 
families — will be significantly disrupted, to 
ensure that no one is left behind.44
As with any industrial transition, jobs would 
shift from sector to sector. For more than 
a decade, the expansion of upstream oil 
drilling and related infrastructure projects 
has created jobs in both existing extraction 
communities and regions with little prior 
oil and gas activity. Efforts to constrain 
the flow of fossil fuels into our economy to 
ensure climate justice — including export 
restrictions — will contract the fossil fuel 
industry, and must be coupled with tailored 
efforts to create new, high-quality job 
opportunities in other industries. To the 
extent that crude export restrictions are 
part of this broader shift away from fossil 
fuel production, just transition policies and 
accompanying investment will be needed 
immediately to support impacted workers. 
Effectively addressing and prioritizing the 
needs and rights of people most impacted 
by the transition away from fossil fuels will 
be one of the most important measures of 
success for just and equitable energy policy 
in 2020 and beyond. This includes workers and communities heavily dependent on the 
production and use of fossil fuels, as well 
as historically marginalized Indigenous and 
low-wealth communities and communities 
of color who have unjustly borne the burden 
of fossil fuel pollution and the resulting 
climate impacts.
If managed properly, the coming transition 
could stand in stark contrast to the job 
losses of past boom-bust cycles of the 
oil commodity markets, or the potential 
coming job losses due to various oil 
industry innovations, including automation. 
The messy and profoundly inequitable 
transition away from coal extraction in most 
of the U.S. provides a preview of what an 
unmanaged and unjust energy transition 
could look like if worker and community protections are not closely paired with 
declines in fossil fuel production. 
To facilitate a well-managed, just transition, 
including with the reimplementation 
of the crude export ban, Congress and 
the president should enact policies and 
programs tailored to the workforce 
conditions of particular industrial sectors 
or geographic regions. Federal action 
should be rooted in democratic processes 
that provide affected workers and 
communities with a significant role in the 
design of policies and programs intended 
to assist them through the transition, with 
meaningful opportunities to review and 
determine the need for expansion and 
improvements. 4. SECURE A JUST AND 
EQUITABLE TRANSITION AWAY 
FROM FOSSIL FUELS
g We use the term “just transition” here knowing that it can often provoke questions and concerns — some of which arise from the different national and historical contexts in which 
it has been used. See, for example, “Just Transition” - Just What Is It? An Analysis of Language, Strategies and Projects,” Labor Network for Sustainability and Strategic Practice: 
Grassroots Policy Project. https://www.labor4sustainability.org/uncategorized/just-transition-just-what-is-it/

5. RECOMMENDATIONS
These findings show that reinstating crude 
oil export restrictions can be a powerful 
component of an ambitious U.S. climate 
change policy. Export restrictions would be 
a crucial tool in halting and reversing the 
ongoing domestic oil and gas production 
boom, and in ensuring that carbon leakage 
from domestic production does not 
undermine climate progress the U.S. makes 
under the next presidential administration.
The next president and Congress should 
consider the following in reinstating the 
crude export ban: 
f  Legally, the next president can impose 
export restrictions only after declaring 
a national emergency.45 It is clear that 
climate change is already creating 
extreme risks for Americans from Alaska 
to Florida. The next president should 
consider declaring a climate emergency 
as a part of his or her response to the 
crisis.
f Congress should act to put crude 
export restrictions on a permanent 
legal footing by reinstating the ban, and 
should consider additional restrictions on 
exporting other fossil fuels, such as coal 
and liquefied natural gas, which would 
generate additional and substantial 
emissions reductions.f The next president and Congress  
should reinstate the crude export ban  
in tandem with policies to ensure a just 
and equitable transition away from  
fossil fuels. 
f Export restrictions should initially focus 
on preventing the continued expansion 
of domestic fossil fuel production and 
exports — to prevent the “lock-in” of 
additional infrastructure and emissions 
— and should fully phase out exports 
as programs to support workers and 
communities are implemented.
f Export restrictions give the federal 
government leverage over emissions 
beyond U.S. borders, and should be 
paired with an expanded commitment 
to international climate finance and 
policies to facilitate the transfer of U.S.-
developed clean energy technology to 
other nations.
f Export restrictions such as the crude 
export ban should be one of a suite of 
policies aimed at halting the expansion of 
fossil fuels and aligning the phase-out of 
U.S. fossil fuel production with domestic 
and global climate targets. Other such 
“supply-side” policies include ending 
new leases for fossil fuel extraction on 
federal lands and waters, ending all fossil 
fuel subsidies and finance, and denying 
permits to new fossil fuel infrastructure 
projects.In addition to export restrictions, the next 
president and Congress should implement 
strong just transition policies, such as the 
following: 
f Any worker impacted by climate policies 
should have five years’ income and 
benefits guaranteed at their current 
level. Fossil fuel companies must be 
held accountable to pay the full wages 
and benefits promised to workers, and 
Congress should act as a backstop 
to ensure full income and benefit 
guarantees to fossil fuel employees who 
lose their jobs due to a managed phase 
out of oil, gas, and coal production.46 
Wage gap coverage and insurance 
guarantees should be provided to 
workers whose new employment pays 
a lower wage. Access to free education, 
skills development, job preparation, and 
training should be provided to fossil 
fuel employees who need support to 
successfully transition to a new career. 
f Apprenticeships and preferential hiring 
practices should be established to 
support workers transitioning out of the 
fossil fuel industry into industries in the 
green economy. Tax incentives should be 
provided to companies that adopt these 
practices with strong labor standards.h 
Support and assistance should be 
provided to workers and families 
wishing to relocate, including moving 
allowances and potential residential 
h Retention bonuses might be required for workers who remain on the job through closure. See, for example, the seven-year Diablo Canyon Nuclear plant transition plan projected for 
2018 to 2025.
i The Pension Benefit Guarantee Program (PBGP) should be adequately funded to cover an increase in claims made by workers formerly employed by fossil fuel companies eliminated 
by the transition to a clean energy economy. For many years the PBGP has had to compensate for the failure of corporations to provide traditional pension benefits. https://www.
gao.gov/key_issues/pbgc_insurance_programs/issue_summary  The Just Transition Commission should work with Congress to anticipate the increased funding needed to rectify 
this failure and anticipate any increase in the number of claims filed by workers affected by the just transition. Providing for a secure path to early retirement for fossil fuel workers is 
an essential element in any well-managed rapid phase-out of the fossil fuel industry. See Pollin et al., 2019.

living subsidies. Early retirement should 
be made available with guaranteed 
pensions and full health benefits,i and 
adequate treatment, counseling, and 
community-based clinical services 
should be provided to workers suffering 
from occupational-related illnesses. 
f Historically disadvantaged communities 
should benefit from the transition. 
Access to free vocational training, apprenticeships, and preferential hiring 
practices should be provided to low-
income communities, people of color, 
and other disadvantaged communities.47
f	Worker representation and collective 
bargaining should be expanded through 
the transition. Policies to enhance 
workers’ rights and give unions power 
over bargaining structures should be 
prioritized. 
f Congress should create a federal Just 
Transition Office to drive economic 
development and expand employment 
in the green economy and to facilitate 
research and coordinate with state and 
local governments, stakeholders, and 
sector-specific planning programs.48
