Previously, the vast majority of offshore oil drilling in the
United States had been conducted from platforms in the
western and central Gulf of Mexico. Three weeks after
President Obama’s announcement, one of those drilling
platforms, the Deepwater Horizon, hovering 40 miles (60
km) southeast of the Louisiana coast, lost control of the
well, exploded and caught fire, killing 11 men and injuring
16 others. Two days later, the rig sank, rupturing the riser
pipe from the wellhead. Later that same day, crews using
Remotely Operated Vehicles reported “large amounts of oil”
flowing from the seabed. The largest oil spill in U.S. history
was underway.

For the next several months, until the leak was finally
capped in July and the well “killed” in September, the world
witnessed efforts on the part of a great many individuals who
worked around the clock to bring the spill under control and
prevent an even greater tragedy for the Gulf. At the same
time, several diligent and determined researchers challenged
official figures and portrayals regarding the rate of oil being
leaked, the total extent of the spill, the fate of the oil and the
state of the gulf ecosystem.

But from the moment the rig caught fire until now, the
overriding concern of the industry and its apologists—includ-
ing far too often the Obama Administration—has been to
downplay the spill’s size and impacts, to look away from
the fundamental failings that allowed the accident to take
place and turn the page as swiftly as possible and return to
business as usual.

AN A ccIDENT WAITIN g TO HAPPEN

On March 31, three weeks before the BP Deepwater Horizon
disaster, President Barack Obama announced plans to
open offshore oil drilling along the east coast of the United
States from Virginia to Florida and the eastern Gulf of Mexico,
ending a decades-long moratorium. He further announced
research to assess the feasibility of offshore drilling in the
Beaufort and Chukchi seas off the north coast of Alaska.

Explaining the 2010 decision was “intended to reduce
dependence on oil imports, generate revenue from the sale
of offshore leases and help win political support for compre-
hensive energy and climate legislation,” the New York Times
wrote “the sheer breadth of the offshore drilling decision will
take some of [the president’s] supporters aback … Even
as Mr. Obama curries favors with pro-drilling interests, he
risks a backlash from some coastal governors, senators and
environmental advocates, who say that the relatively small
amounts of oil to be gained in the offshore areas are not
worth the environmental risks.”

Noting “opposition to offshore drilling — for fear of pollution
of the seas and coastline — has been one of the key galva-
nizing forces of the environmental movement for more than
40 years,” Politico quoted Greenpeace Executive Director
Phil Radford warning offshore drilling “threatens our oceans
and the coastal communities that depend on them with
devastating oil spills.”

At no stage did BP or the Coast Guard conduct accurate
measurements of the amount of oil emanating from the
broken riser pipe. This decision meant any assessment
of the spill’s ultimate size had to be inferred and put BP in
a position where it could challenge any final figure as an
over-estimate, and thus seek to reduce the amount of any
fine it would have to pay. This uncertainty foretells a legal
dilemma for the Obama—and successive—administrations.
Either contest BP’s assertions of a low estimate of oil spilled,
thus extending litigation—perhaps for years—arguing this
crucial point and delaying final resolution and reparations for
injured parties or agree to BP’s number—which independent
experts have doubted since the beginning—and let justice
be cheated. Certainly, from the moment the leak began, BP
sought to minimize its size.

Initially, the company estimated oil was gushing into the
Gulf at the rate of approximately 1,000 barrels, or 42,000
gallons, a day. By the end of April, a government estimate
had upped that figure to 5,000 barrels, or 210,000 gallons,
daily. Although the latter number became widely repeated,
it was soon challenged. Ian MacDonald, an oceanographer
at Florida State University, made his own rough calculations
using satellite imagery and concluded that the leak could
“easily be four or five times” the government estimate, which
the New York Times reported had been arrived at using a
protocol that is specifically not recommended for such large
spills. BP senior vice president Kent Wells claimed that there
was “just no way” to measure the amount of oil gushing
from the pipe, but scientists who use underwater equipment
to measure the flow rate of natural hydrothermal vents
countered that that equipment could easily be used to do so.
Two such researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution were in fact in communication with BP and were
poised in early May to fly to the Gulf to begin measuring the
flow, until being contacted by BP and told not to come. They
were not given a reason.

By mid-May, researchers such as Dr. Samantha Joye from
the University of Georgia had discovered the oil was forming
enormous undersea plumes, including one 10 miles long,
three miles wide and up to 300 feet thick in places. This
again suggested that figures of spill rate derived from mea-

surements of surface slicks were gross underestimates. By
now, however, BP was categorically refusing any entreaties
to measure the amount of oil entering the Gulf. “The answer
is no to that,” said BP spokesperson Tom Mueller. “We’re not
going to take any extra efforts now to calculate flow there at
this point.”

That was in May and in public. By early July, in cor-
respondence with the US Coast Guard, BP Exploration and
Production COO Doug Suttles requested approval to apply
dispersants at the wellhead based on a flow rate of 53,000
barrels per day. (Bob Cavnar “Disaster on the Horizon,”
Chelsea Green Books, p. 93)

In December, a BP white paper delivered to the presidential
commission investigating the spill estimated the actual
amount of oil spilled may have been 20–50 percent lower
than the government’s official 4.9 million-barrel estimate.

Following the establishment of the multi-agency Flow Rate
Technical Group and the availability of high-resolution video,
estimates became more accurate, and proved to be in
excess even of those calculated by Ian MacDonald. The
Flow Rate Technical Group ultimately concluded that the
well initially spewed 62,000 barrels a day, easing to 53,000
as the well slowly depleted itself, for a grand total of 4.9
million barrels, or 205.8 million gallons, by the time the well
was capped. The group calculated that 800,000 barrels
were captured at source, meaning 4.1 million barrels actually
entered Gulf waters; however, the first peer-reviewed esti-
mate, published in the journal Science in October, nudged
this final figure up to 4.4 million barrels, or 185 million gallons.
The Science study reached its conclusions using the same
methodology for measuring hydrothermal vents that BP had
rejected in May.

In addition to the oil, massive quantities of natural gas were
also spewing into the Gulf. This gas “spill” was not part of
the news story, but scientists were watching and wondering
about the environmental impact. The most recent studies
published in February 2011 estimate the gaseous hydrocar-
bons may have comprised 40 percent of the total spill by
weight. (http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n3/full/ngeo1067.html)

release the oil budget calculator as soon as possible. Bob
Perciasepe, deputy administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency, expressed concern about the portrayal of
the percentages of oil that had been chemically and naturally
dispersed, arguing that “the percentages are very rough
and should not be considered accurate” and predicting that
“these calculations are extremely rough estimates yet when
they are put into the press—which we want to happen—they
will take on a life of their own.” Following the report’s
release and Browner’s comment, NOAA administrator Jane
Lubchenco sent an e-mail appearing to distance her agency
from it—“I would hope that everyone would emphasize that
this was an interagency report, not just a NOAA report”—and
also, like MacDonald and Blum, taking issue with Browner’s
core assertion: “It is not accurate to say that 75% of the oil is
gone.”

cl AIMINg V IcTORY

By early June, oil from the spill washed along the coasts of
the Gulf of Mexico. It continued to do so, at varying rates and
frequency, for several months. As late as late November 2010,
oil was still reaching deep into Louisiana marshes, coating
baby crabs and adult shrimp. And yet industry and govern-
ment have been desperate to claim success in removing oil
from the Gulf, and to thus turn the page on the story, almost
from day one.

Perhaps most jarring was the August 4, 2010 comment by
Carol Browner, at that time the president’s special adviser on
energy and climate change, that “more than three-quarters of
the oil is gone. The vast majority of the oil is gone.” Her claim
was based on a governmental Oil Budget Calculator, which
estimated that 17 percent of the oil had been captured at the
wellhead, 8 percent burned or skimmed at the surface, and
49 percent naturally or chemically dispersed, dissolved or
evaporated. The claim was immediately attacked by indepen-
dent scientists. Michael Blum of Tulane university pointed out
that “the estimates can also be interpreted as indicating that
50 to 75 percent of the oil remains in the environment,” given
that oil that had been dispersed or dissolved had not disap-
peared, but remained in the water. Ian MacDonald criticized
the inclusion of the 17 percent that had been captured at the
wellhead—“No one cares about oil that wasn’t released,” he
said—and argued that many of the figures were “complete
theoretical conjecture.” He continued: “To present such a
bunch of speculation as actual scientific fact doesn’t strike
me as the actions of a responsible regulatory agency. I don’t
know that it’s necessarily inaccurate, but to say as a scientific
fact that it’s gone from the system, that it has biodegraded …
I’m sorry, that’s baloney.”

E-mail correspondence acquired by Greenpeace under the
Freedom of Information Act shows that concern was shared
by some responsible for the report on which Browner based
her claim, and that the administration was keen to portray
a rosy scenario as soon as possible. Heather Zichal, then
deputy to Carol Browner in the White House, reported in
late July that she was “getting pressure” to complete and

Documents recovered by Greenpeace FOIA requests also
demonstrate the extent to which BP was anxious to steer
scientific research into the spill, by securing representation
on all Natural Resource Damage Assessment committees,
seeking to gain authority to approve the scope of NOAA mis-
sions, hoping to steer research toward “restoration” instead
of impacts and pushing a positive message. BP provided
extensive funding for researchers who were willing to work
within the company’s parameters, while other scientists
chose to turn down such offers when advised that their work
would likely be involved in potential defense litigation against
state or federal government and would potentially not be
published for three years.

Additionally, several independent researchers found BP
unresponsive to requests for access or data, while University
of South Florida researchers who were among the first to
announce the discovery of undersea plumes say they were
effectively told to “shut up.”

As a result, Greenpeace sent its ship Arctic Sunrise to the
Gulf, to provide a platform for independent researchers to
investigate. Over the course of over two months, the Sunrise,
its crew and guest researchers studied the Gulf from west
to east, top to bottom, close to the spill site and farther
afield. The Arctic Sunrise hosted scientists studying sponges,
plankton, whales, chemistry and benthic ecology.

GREENPEACE APRIL 2011

Caz Taylor and Erin Grey of Tulane University towed plankton
nets to collect blue crab larvae, which they examined for
signs of oil and dispersant. A consortium of scientists from
the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center (LADC) deployed
and retrieved acoustic monitoring buoys to record vocaliza-
tions of sperm and beaked whales, information that could
help shed light on what impact the spill might have had
on populations of those species. Rainer Amon and Clifton
Nunnally of Texas A&M University looked for signs of oil
in the water column and on the seabed. And using a Dual
Deep Worker submersible, we worked with Steve Ross of
the University of North Carolina and Sandra Brooke of the
Marine Conservation Biology Institute to examine possible
impacts of the oil on deep sea corals.

Not all the conclusions have yet been reached; science can
be a deliberate process. But some signs are already evident.
Caz and Erin discovered mysterious orange blobs turning up
in their larval samples; if they turn out to be oil or dispersant,
it will be a strong and worrying sign that contaminants
are entering the food chain. Natalia Sidorovskaia of LADC
reports their preliminary findings indicate a decrease in the
presence of sperm whales in the vicinity of the Deepwater
Horizon site; further studies will determine whether that
decrease is temporary or permanent, but if it is the result of
any increase in mortality, it will be reason for considerable
concern, given statements by NOAA scientists that the loss
of even three adult sperm whales could be enough to lead to
the demise of the entire population in the Gulf.

The Texas A&M team, not unexpectedly, found plenty of
evidence of oil in the waters and sediments of the Gulf,
several months after it began gushing. Their instruments
found clear signs of an oxygen deficiency in the Gulf’s waters,
in an area stretching from around the Deepwater Horizon
disaster site to 300 miles (500km) to the west—signs that
hydrocarbon-eating bacteria were still working on devouring
oil in the water. The infamous plume still existed—perhaps
not visibly, but the essence of it was still there, in October, a
full six months after the blowout.

But the levels of dissolved oxygen were not low enough to
suggest that bacteria had been eating the oil to the degree
that officials had indicated was likely the case. If the oil was
largely no longer at the surface and if it appeared to be in
the water column at lesser amounts than might have been
expected, then where was it? Amon and his colleagues
suspected it was settling on the bottom—and so it proved.
Using a “box core”—a steel device that captures mud
from the bottom and the water just above it—the scientists
hauled aboard a series of samples from 4,000 feet (1,300
meters) below the surface. And in several of the samples
was clear evidence—in sight and smell—of oil. At around the
same time, researchers on board the research vessel Cape
Hatteras similarly found oil on the bottom, up to 140 miles
from the wellhead. And while the presence of oil should not
in and of itself have been especially surprising given that
the area had just experienced the largest spill in the nation’s
history, its discovery raised some questions, as Kert Davies
of Greenpeace pointed out:

“Why is the oil so fresh and smelly and liquid? Aren’t those
oil loving bacteria supposed to be breaking it down? Or is it
more like what other scientists have said, that the bacteria
are unlikely to be as active at such extreme pressure [and]
low temperatures?” he asked rhetorically in a blog from on
board the Arctic Sunrise. “How much is down here? Did it
come straight from the busted well? Was it hit with disper-
sant that made it sink? Or did it rain down from the surface
after being hit with dispersant? All open questions.”

Fortunately, the deep sea corals that scientists and crew
explored weeks later with the Dual Deep Worker submarine
showed no sign of oil contamination. Sadly, it increasingly
appears as if that was an aberration. In November, a team
of researchers led by Charles Fisher of Penn State University
discovered a community of corals that included many
recently dead colonies and others that clearly are dying.
The corals, said Fisher, had “been impacted fairly recently
by something very toxic.” He added: “The proximity of the
site to the disaster, the depth of the site, the clear evidence
of recent impact, and the uniqueness of the observations
all suggest that the impact we have found is linked to
the exposure of this community to either oil, dispersant,
extremely depleted oxygen, or some combination of these or
other water-borne effects resulting from the spill.”

GREENPEACE APRIL 2011

In February, Samantha Joye of the University of Georgia
released preliminary findings of December research showing
microbes were removing oil from the bottom far less rapidly
than expected. In September, she described a substantial
layer of oily sediment, in places up to two inches thick,
spreading for miles along the seafloor; returning two months
later, she surprised to find how little of this oil had dissipated
or degraded. “There’s some sort of a bottleneck we have yet
to identify for why this stuff doesn’t seem to be degrading,”
Joye told the American Association for the Advancement
of Science annual conference in Washington, D.C. “Magic
microbes consumed maybe 10 percent of the total dis-
charge, the rest of it we don’t know,” Joye added. “There’s a
lot of it out there.”

Meanwhile, the USF team that reported increased oil in
sediments from the deep sea bed also was surprised to
discover “black goo” in nearshore sediments off the coast
of Alabama in January. It looked like oil, but smelled of
sulfur, not petroleum. Laboratory analysis revealed the goo
was composed of dead plankton and other organisms that
had adhered to each other. Water from the mud, according
to one of the research team, was “toxic as all bejeesus”.
According to USF’s David Hollander, it’s certain “that these
unique sediments have accumulated within the past year
and that their origin is contemporaneous with the timing of
the oiling and use of dispersants.”

Remarkably, despite the continued uncertainty and signs
of previously-unanticipated damage, Kenneth Feinberg, the
lawyer appointed by the Obama administration to oversee a
victims’ compensation fund for the spill, asserted in February
that “it is reasonable to conclude” the Gulf will achieve “full
recovery by the end of 2012.”

It is a claim given little credence by researchers such as Ian
MacDonald.

“The Gulf is not all better now,” he has said. “We don’t know
what we’ve done to it.”

Indeed, in January 2011, researchers from the University of
South Florida (USF) found a layer of oily sediment that was
actually five times thicker than they had recorded in August
2010, and which spread for many miles in all directions from
the wellhead.

The long-term environmental consequences can, as yet,
only be speculated upon. Even the scale of the damage that
has already been done remains uncertain. Officially, as of
November 2010, 6,814 dead animals had been collected,
including over 6,000 dead birds, almost 700 sea turtles, and
101 dolphins, porpoises and whales. But many casualties
may have simply not been witnessed, the birds and other
creatures who crawled deeper into the marsh to escape
the oil onshore or the giant filter-feeding whale sharks, seen
swimming in water thick with oil shortly after the Deepwater
Horizon sank, prompting Eric Hoffmayer of the University of
Southern Mississippi to observe that, “At the end of the day,
if these animals were feeding in an area where there was
surface oil, and if they ingested oil, there is a good possibility
that they died and sank to the bottom. At this point we have
no idea how many animals have been impacted.”

In March 2011, a paper in the journal Conservation Biology
concluded that total mortality of dolphins and whales as a
result of the spill may have been 50 times higher than the
original estimate, and that as many as 5,050 may have been
killed, out of sight. Furthermore, impacts on Gulf wildlife may
be continuing, almost twelve months after the accident. In
March, 39 dead sea turtles washed ashore on the islands
and mainland of the Mississippi Sound, most of them the
endangered Kemp’s Ridley turtle. During the first three
months of the year, 139 cetaceans washed ashore dead
along the Gulf coast, compared to an average of approxi-
mately 31 for the years 2002-9. Some researchers who were
contracted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
to document the increased mortality and to collect samples
for analysis complained that they were instructed in a letter
from the agency that “no data or findings may be released,
presented or discussed … without prior approval” and that
they had privately admonished by federal officials for ‘speak-
ing out of turn” to the media. Some also expressed disbelief
at the amount of time that NMFS was taking to deliver
samples to laboratories for testing. “It is surprising that it has
been almost a full year since the spill, and they still haven’t
selected labs for this kind of work,” observed one.

AND T HEN W HAT?

On May 22, 2010, President Obama announced the forma-
tion of a National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon
Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, which he tasked with determin-
ing the causes of the accident and providing recommenda-
tions on how to prevent—and mitigate the impact of—any
future spills that result from offshore drilling.

Eight days later, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar imposed a
six-month moratorium on deepwater offshore drilling. In a
press release, Salazar stated that the moratorium would
“provide time to implement new safety requirements and to
allow the Presidential Commission to complete its work...With
the BP oil spill still growing in the Gulf, and investigations and
reviews still underway, a six month pause in drilling is needed,
appropriate, and prudent.”

The moratorium would not end all offshore production in
the Gulf, and would affect only 33 deepwater drilling sites,
fewer than one percent of the oil and gas platforms in the
region; even so and as oil continued to gush into the Gulf,
the industry, rather than accept the prudence of a pause,
fought the moratorium in court. After the initial pause was
overturned, the administration established a second, revised
moratorium in June.

Meanwhile, the commission began its investigation into the
spill, ultimately publishing its final report in January 2011.
At the heart of its findings was a conclusion that neither
government nor industry, in their combined desire to extract
as much oil as possible as widely as possible, paid adequate
attention to the potential risks associated with an inherently
dangerous undertaking:

Investments in safety, containment, and response equipment
and practices failed to keep pace with the rapid move
into deepwater drilling. Absent major crises, and given
the remarkable financial returns available from deepwater
reserves, the business culture succumbed to a false sense of
security. The Deepwater Horizon disaster exhibits the costs
of a culture of complacency …There are recurring themes
of missed warning signals, failure to share information, and
a general lack of appreciation for the risks involved … But
that complacency affected government as well as industry.
The Commission has documented the weaknesses and the

GREENPEACE APRIL 2011

inadequacies of the federal regulation and oversight, and
made important recommendations for changes in legal
authority, regulations, investments in expertise, and manage-
ment.

The commission concluded that, although offshore drilling
is inherently dangerous and even though what happened to
the Deepwater Horizon could “be traced to a series of iden-
tifiable mistakes made by BP, Halliburton, and Transocean
that reveal such systematic failures in risk management that
they place in doubt the safety culture of the entire industry,”
the accident could and should have been prevented.

To increase the likelihood of preventing such accidents
in the future, the Commission made a number of recom-
mendations. While some, such as the establishment of an
industry-run safety organization similar to that established
by the nuclear industry following Three Mile Island, smacked
too much of foxes guarding the hen house and ignored the
inadequacy and lack of transparency that has bedeviled the
nuclear model, others were more substantive and welcome.
They ranged from the establishment of an independent
agency within the Department of the Interior with enforce-
ment authority to oversee all aspects of offshore drilling
safety as well as the structural and operational integrity of all
offshore energy production facilities, to involving NOAA and
the United States Geological Survey in drilling lease review,
to spending the majority of money from BP disaster fines
and penalties on environmental restoration in the Gulf of
Mexico.

In December 2010, one month before the commission
published its findings, the Obama Administration announced
a partial reversal of its March position, stating that it would
no longer proceed to allow offshore offshore drilling off the
Atlantic coast or in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Secretary
Salazar told reporters that that the decision to remove those
areas from drilling until at least 2017 was “based on our
nation’s experience with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.”

By the time the administration had taken some new areas
off the table, however, it had already re-opened entry to the
existing buffet. In October, Salazar announced the deepwater
drilling moratorium in the Gulf, which had been imposed in
May and which had been scheduled to expire on November
30, would be lifted one month early—conveniently enough,
in advance of midterm elections to Congress. Greenpeace
denounced the decision as “pure politics of the most cynical
kind.”

The Deepwater Horizon accident resulted in an estimated
200 million gallons of oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico; [4.9
million bbls x 42 gal/bbl = 206 million gallons] it was the
largest spill in the history of the United States and one of the
largest in history. The environmental impacts are still being
assessed, but seem likely to include profound changes to the
Gulf’s ecosystem.

GREENPEACE APRIL 2011

In March, the results of a forensic inquiry into the Blowout
Preventer, the piece of equipment that should have sealed
the leak almost immediately oil began gushing, found that
its design was fundamentally flawed in that it was unable to
perform as planned because the force of the escaping oil
caused the wellhead pipe to buckle—a finding that calls into
question the safety of every offshore platform currently in
operation. That same month, Justice Department investiga-
tors announced they had not ruled out bringing manslaughter
charges against companies and managers responsible for
the Deepwater Horizon accident.

yeT, The oil indusTry conTinues To acT as if noTh-
ing had happened, or even as if iT has been The
wronged parTy.

In March, Transocean, the company that owned the
Deepwater Horizon, awarded bonuses to its top executives
for achieving the “best year in safety performance in our
company’s history”. Industry apologists and conservative
media continue to complain falsely that the Obama adminis-
tration “shut down” offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico by
establishing what one commentator referred to as a “perma-
torium”. And industry advocates continue to complain about
the pace at which the Interior department has been granting
leases for offshore exploration and drilling.

Meanwhile, the oil industry continues to eye even more dan-
gerous territory in its search for profit. As the Arctic Sunrise
conducted its research in the Gulf of Mexico, crew of the
Greenpeace ship Esperanza spent over 40 hours occupying
the Stena Don rig in Baffin Bay, Greenland, highlighting the
industry’s desire to expand into the perilous waters of the
Arctic. When the Obama Administration removed the Atlantic
and eastern Gulf of Mexico from drilling, it did not do the
same for the Arctic waters of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas;
already, Shell has announced it plans to drill six exploratory
wells in the region in 2012 and 2013, although it has yet to
submit formal requests to do so. Such enthusiasm for drilling
in the maritime Arctic has apparently not been stunted by
BP’s December announcement that it was suspending work
on its own Liberty oil field development in the Beaufort Sea
because of a “number of problems that have arisen during
the rig’s construction on a man-made island.”

DEEPWATER HORIZON

As a report commissioned and published by the Pew Envi-
ronment Group made explicitly clear, the oil industry’s plans
for the Arctic once again demonstrate the complacency and
failure to plan fully for possible disaster that was highlighted
so clearly by the Gulf of Mexico spill:

Response plans not only fail to realistically account for the
harsh climate and remote location, but they also make overly
optimistic assumptions. For example, plans presume that 90
percent of the oil would be removed in an Arctic marine spill
when less than 20 percent was actually recovered in the Gulf
of Mexico and less than 8 percent in the 1989 Exxon Valdez
oil spill.

Using booms to contain ocean spills, then removing the
oil and burning it or applying chemical dispersants can
be challenging enough in temperate waters. Assumptions
about how these techniques would work in extreme Arctic
conditions are based on small-scale, controlled experiments
or guesswork.

The report highlighted numerous elements that make
addressing a spill in the Arctic vastly more difficult than
one in the Gulf or other temperate climes, not the least of
them being the fact that ice, cold temperatures, and 10
to 30 foot seas can impede the deployment of boats and
skimmers and tear containment booms or that low visibility
and hurricane-strength winds can make finding oil slicks
all but impossible. Indeed, simply getting equipment and
trained personnel to a spill site in the Alaskan Arctic would
be a monumentally difficult task, given such logistical issues
as the existence of a solitary road connecting Prudhoe Bay,
on Alaska’s Beaufort Sea, to central Alaska, 415 miles south
and the complete absence of any roads linking the Chukchi
sea coast to the rest of Alaska. In addition, the nearest major
port (Unalaska, in the Aleutian Islands) is 1,300 nautical miles
from Point Barrow, where the Beaufort and Chukchi seas
meet.

The report also highlights that computer models have not
been developed to adequately predict how an oil spill in
the U.S. Arctic Ocean would interact with sea ice and that
little baseline science exists for measuring the effects of an
oil spill on Arctic ecosystems and food webs that support
walrus, polar bears and other marine mammals found
nowhere else in the United States.

Such immense gaps in knowledge and readiness do not
appear to be an impediment to oil companies’ plans to drill
in the Arctic. But the desire to drill in the Arctic has not in
any way removed oil companies’ enthusiasm for operating in
more familiar environments.

bAck TO  b usINE ss

On April 3, 2011, media in the UK reported that BP had
negotiated a deal with the Obama Administration to allow
it to resume deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, drilling
that it anticipated would resume in the summer of 2011, a
little over a year after the Deepwater Horizon tragedy began
unfolding. The following morning, Politico summed up the
essence of the announcement in three words: “BP: What
spill?”
