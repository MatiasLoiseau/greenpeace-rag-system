TOXIC CHILDRENSWEAR BY DISNEY

– A WORLDWIDE INVESTIGATION OF HAZARDOUS

CHEMICALS IN DISNEY CLOTHES

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report shows that chemicals that may present a long-term hazard to

human health are present in Disney childrenswear. Disney garments, including

T-shirts, pyjamas and underwear, were bought in retail outlets in 19 countries

around the world and the printed logo sections analysed for a number of

chemicals by the Danish independent laboratory Eurofins.

The results show clear differences in the chemical content of the finished gar-

ments. The bad news is that most prints contained high levels of one or other of

the hazardous chemicals. The good news is that some Disney prints have been

produced without using certain of these hazardous chemicals. This provides a

strong indication that, if Disney cared about chemical contaminants in their chil-

drenswear, hazardous substances could be substituted or simply avoided.

Greenpeace has urged Disney to take responsibility for avoiding or substituting

harmful chemicals in their products. When licensing their logo and characters

for use on their products, Disney should demand that their licensees implement

a chemical policy that protects children’s health. Disney reacted by stating that

their products are in line with the law, and therefore took no further action.

While voluntary initiatives to phase out hazardous substances by retailers such

as H&M are welcome and show that chemical substitution is possible, the reac-

tion by Disney demonstrates that only legislation can ensure that these chemi-

cals are not allowed to be produced and used. For this reason, Greenpeace

demands that the global Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants

and the European Union’s chemical policy reform embrace the principle of

mandatory substitution, which requires replacing the use of hazardous chemi-

cals with safer alternatives.

INTRODUCTION

Although the widespread presence of
hazardous man-made chemicals in the
environment is increasingly being docu-
mented, few people are aware that
many of these same chemicals are found
in children’s clothes. Greenpeace under-
took this investigation as part of its cam-
paign to show how dangerous chemi-
cals are out of control, turning up in
house dust, in household products,
food, rain water, in our clothes……and
ultimately in our bodies.1

Before a garment reaches the shops,

it has been through many processing
steps that contribute to its overall chemi-
cal footprint and the final chemical
residues remaining in the finished prod-
uct. Manufacture of fibres and yarn, pre-
treatment, dyeing, printing, aftercare
and preservation all involve the use of
chemicals, including inevitable direct
releases to the environment during man-
ufacture and the potential for long-term
dispersive releases of chemicals from the
finished textiles during wear, laundering
and final disposal.

Chemically processed textiles

inevitably contribute to our overall expo-
sure to chemicals from consumer prod-
ucts, as well as providing a more direct
route of chemical exposure through con-
tact with the skin. Of course, whilst it has
not been conclusively proven that such
exposure is causing adverse health effects,
given the hazards associated with the
chemicals in question, there is absolutely
no reason for complacence.

To date, the issue of chemical expo-
sure in consumer products has generally
been poorly investigated and improperly
assessed. It is vital that consumer products

1  See Campaigns, Toxics at: http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/

should be safe to use and are free from
hazardous chemicals. So far, there is no
guarantee that this is the case and grow-
ing evidence to the contrary. In effect, the
consumer currently has no right to know
which products contain hazardous addi-
tives or contaminants and no way to
make informed decisions to minimise
or avoid their exposure to hazardous
chemicals.

Toxic chemicals

in childrenswear?

TESTING OF
DISNEY CHILDRENSWEAR

In late 2003, Greenpeace bought a range
of Disney childrenswear, including t-
shirts, vests, pyjamas, rainwear and under-
wear, from 19 countries around the
world, including Europe, Asia, North and
South America and New Zealand. The
printed sections of the garments bearing
the Disney logo or a Disney trademarked
character were analysed for substances
which may be capable of causing repro-
ductive and immune system disorders,
hormone mimicking or even cancer in a
variety of living organisms (see Annex A).

The independent Danish laboratory,
Eurofins2, conducted the chemical
analyses on behalf of Greenpeace.

THE SUBSTANCES THAT GREENPEACE
ASKED EUROFINS TO LOOK FOR WERE:

1. Phthalates – toxic and widely used
for plasticizing (softening) PVC. PVC
prints are one of the uses of phthalate-
plasticized PVC that could lead to
long periods of direct skin contact in
children, plus the potential for inhala-
tion and even ingestion of additional
quantities (Lewis et al. 1994)3.  The EU
has classified two types of phthalates –
DEHP and DBP – as ‘toxic to repro-
duction’ (EU 2003a).

2. Alkylphenol ethoxylates – including
octyl and nonyl phenolethoxylates.
Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs) are
used in industrial detergents, though
these chemicals, and the related
alkylphenols, have many other com-
mercial applications. Alkylphenols,
which are also formed through the envi-
ronmental degradation of their ethoxy-
lates, are best known for their hor-
mone-disrupting properties, which can
lead to altered sexual development in
some organisms (Jobling et al. 1995).

3. Organotins – toxic and used as sta-
bilisers in PVC. Textiles containing
polymer parts, like T-shirts with prints,
can contain organotin compounds
such as butyl- and octyltin compounds.
Approximately 15,000 tonnes of organ-
otins were used in PVC in Europe in
1995. (Ortepa, 2000) Organotins have
been shown to have immunotoxic and
developmental properties in mammals
(Kergosien and Rice 1998).

4. Lead – toxic and used in colours and

as a stabiliser in PVC. In 2002, stabiliser
usage was reported as 120,000
tonnes/year (ENDS 2002). The
impacts of lead on the developing nerv-
ous system of children are of extreme
concern, and can result in a permanent
lowering of IQ (Nielsen et al. 2001).

5. Cadmium – toxic and used as pigment
and a stabiliser. Recent data derived
from cadmium flows in the EU for
around the year 2000 indicate that 300-
350 tonnes of cadmium were used in
pigments and 150 tonnes in stabilisers
per year (EC 2002). The International
Agency for Research on Cancer and
the US Department of Health and
Human Services both classify cadmium
and cadmium compounds as carcino-
genic to humans (USDHHS 2000 and
IARC 1994).

6. Formaldehyde – toxic and used for

pre-shrinkage treatment and fixation of
dyes & pigments. The International
Agency for Research on Cancer has
classified formaldehyde as a probable
carcinogen in humans (IARC 1995).

Disney used to be fun

– now it turns out

to be TOXIC

DIVERSE RESULTS

Eighteen of the products tested were
Disney prints applied to woven fabric,
such as T-shirts, pyjamas and underwear.
The results show that these Disney
prints contain chemicals that are inher-

ently hazardous.4 A comparison of the
chemical content of various printed sec-
tions of the fabrics reveals that similar
products contain vastly different
amounts of hazardous chemicals.

1. PHTHALATES

Although all the printed sections of the
fabrics contain phthalates, the amounts
vary enormously. The printed section of
the Danish Tigger vest
has a total phthalate con-
tent of 1.4 mg/kg, while
the Slovak Tigger bib sample contains
200,000 mg/kg total phthalates – more
than 20% by weight of the sample. The
Dutch Donald Duck T-shirt print con-
tained 170,036 mg/kg total phthalates –
more than 17% by weight of the sample.
This suggests that the garments may have
been printed with PVC-based plastisol
prints. Whilst the prints on garments
from Belgium, Canada, Norway, China,
Spain and USA contained high levels of
phthalates, at between 42 and 101 g/kg
or 4% - 10% by weight (Eurofins, 2003),
by comparison 6 other prints contained
less than 0.1 gram of phthalates/kg.

We know that

these chemicals

are toxic.

So why are

Disney using

them when they

can be avoided?

phthalate contamination from e.g. carry-over

of processing chemicals rather than deliberate

addition of phthalates to the clothing, as these

lower concentrations would be unlikely to

confer any significant plasticizing effect.

Marks & Spencer is currently phasing out the

use of PVC, phthalates and alkylphenol

ethoxylates: by autumn 2003, 70% of

childrenswear with printed motifs was free
of these substances, and by autumn 2004, all

childrenswear with prints is to be free of these

Really necessary?

substances.

Substitution of PVC plastisol printing with

non-PVC alternatives is undoubtedly the sim-

plest way to avoid the use of phthalates in chil-

dren’s clothing. In 2002, global clothes retailer

Hennes & Mauritz entirely substituted PVC

and PVC prints for all their applications,

amply showing that there is positive solution

to the current “laissez faire” chemical policy of

Disney. The low levels of phthalates in the

H&M-purchased vest from Denmark indicate

2. ALKYLPHENOL ETHOXYLATES
(APES)

This chemical group includes: nonylphe-
nol ethoxylates (NPEs) and octylpheno-
lethoxylates (OPEs). They were found in
all the Disney products tested, in levels
ranging from 34.1 mg/kg in the Princess
T-shirt from Canada to 1,700 mg/kg in
the Austrian Minnie Mouse pyjamas.

Really necessary?
Marks & Spencer is currently phasing out the
use of PVC, phthalates and alkylphenol
ethoxylates. By autumn 2004, their target is to
phase out the use of these substances in all
their childrenswear bearing printed motifs.
Hennes & Mauritz are to investigate the use
of these substances to try to find candidates
for substitution (Hennes & Mauritz 2004).
The Danish EPA (2000) has recommended
nonylphenolethoxylates for substitution or
for their use to be limited to an absolute
minimum, stating that: “for all uses and in
all circumstances it is possible to find suit-
able alternatives”.

3. ORGANOTINS

Of the 16 products tested for organotins,
7 did not have levels above the detection
limit. However the Dutch Donald Duck
T-shirt contained 474 microg/kg total
organotins, indicating the use of organo-
tin as a PVC stabiliser.

Organotins are hazardous!

What did the Dutch Donald

Duck do to deserve so much,

when it can’t even be detected

in the Danish Disney Tigger?

Really necessary?
The fact that organotins were not present at
levels above detection limits in some of the
garments analysed suggests that the sub-
stance is not necessary or that alternative
substances are available to perform the same
function, either in processing or in the final
product, such that the presence of organotin
compounds in finished garments could be
avoided entirely.

4. LEAD

Lead was found in all of the Disney prod-
ucts sampled, ranging from 0.14 mg/kg to
2,600 mg/kg in a Canadian Princess T-
shirt and 76 mg/kg of lead in the Belgian
Mickey Mouse T-shirt.

Not fair! The Canadian Princess

is so toxic, that she’d be illegal

in Denmark

Really necessary?
The presence of lead is unacceptable and
according to clothes retailer Hennes &
Mauritz (2004), the low levels are probably
due to contamination, since there is no reason
to add lead to the production process. The
Danish EPA (2000) similarly concludes that:
“low level concentrations are likely to be
impurities in colours” and that: “the big pro-
ducers have all developed special metal-free
colour and pigmentation series”. Alternatives
to lead stabilisers are also available e.g. calcium-
zinc based or organic stabilisers (ENDS
2003). Lead stabilisers are already phased out
in Sweden, and Denmark recently imposed a
wide-ranging ban on the import, marketing
and manufacture of lead and products con-
taining lead (MEE 2000), making the
Canadian Disney Princess T-shirt illegal on
the Danish market.

5. CADMIUM

Cadmium was identified in 14 of the 18
Disney products tested, at levels ranging
from 0.0069 mg/kg in the Finding Nemo
T-shirt bought in the UK to 38 mg/kg in
the Belgian Mickey Mouse T-shirt. Five

of the products tested did not have levels
above the detection limit.

Really necessary?

The presence of cadmium in textiles is unac-

ceptable. The Danish EPA (2000) suggests that

high levels of cadmium in textiles are proba-

bly caused by cadmium used as PVC stabiliser
or (less likely) as pigmentation. Given that

PVC print can be readily substituted and the

fact that cadmium is not found in all samples,

demonstrates that materials or process substi-

tution can avoid the presence of cadmium.

6. FORMALDEHYDE

Formaldehyde was found in 8 of the 15
products tested for this chemical, in levels
ranging from 23 mg/kg in the Princess
Ariel T-shirt bought in Argentina to 1,100
mg/kg in the Finding Nemo T-shirt
bought in the UK.

Wow! If Buzz Lightyear  from the Philippines can

be formaldehyde-free - why is poor Nemo from the

UK drowning in this nasty chemical?

Really necessary?
The fact that formaldehyde is not detected in
half of the garments is a strong indication that
this toxic chemical is not an essential compo-
nent of finished garments. Formaldehyde
might have been eliminated by using
formaldehyde-free processes, or by effective
washing processes that remove the chemical.
In the latter case, only consumer exposure is
eliminated, but environmental and occupa-
tional health problems remain.

A nineteenth sample

A nineteenth sample tested by Eurofins
was a German Winnie the Pooh PVC rain-
coat - the only non-textile to be analysed.
This contains an astounding 320,000
mg/kg total phthalates, or 32% by weight
of the raincoat! The PVC raincoat also
contained 1,129 micrograms/kg organo-
tins, indicating the use of organotin as a
PVC stabiliser.

CHEMICALS OUT OF CONTROL
IN DISNEY CLOTHES

These results show that chemicals which,
due to their intrinsic properties, may
present a long-term hazard to human
health and the environment are present
in Disney garments. While we cannot
know how much their presence in
clothes contributes to overall exposure,
it should not be assumed that there will
be no adverse effects.

Moreover, it would appear that many

of the chemicals identified in this study
are likely to be present as a result of the
use of PVC plastisol printing tech-

niques which, through comparison
of products, prove to be by no
means essential.  Such prints
may be relatively cheap to

apply in complex and attractive designs,
but other printing techniques that do not
rely on the use of phthalates, alkylphenol
ethoxylates and other hazardous chemi-
cals are widely available. Much of the
chemical exposure which could result
from the wearing and laundering of many
of the Disney garments analysed in this
study can be avoided entirely by the
mandatory substitution of hazardous
chemicals where they are unnecessary.
Greenpeace believes that Disney, who is
marketing garments for children, should
not disregard the fact that hazardous
chemicals are being used in the produc-
tion of garments.

Hmmm! Doesn’t it make

sense for Disney to withdraw

these toxic products?)

EVIDENCE OF SUBSTITUTION

The results show that some of the prints
have been produced without using certain
hazardous chemicals.

The good news is that these chemi-
cals are not necessary and it is possible to
make a printed T-shirt without them.
Clearly, some manufacturers have avoid-
ed the use of hazardous chemicals or
have substituted them with safer alterna-

tives. An important player in reducing the
presence of hazardous chemicals is the
retailer. The Danish Tigger vest was
bought at Hennes & Mauritz (H&M),
a global clothes retailer which in 2002
decided to substitute PVC and PVC
prints in all their products. This explains
the low or non-detectable levels of PVC
additives in the Tigger vest, bought at an
H&M outlet in Denmark.

The bad news is that most prints con-

tained high levels of one or other of the
hazardous chemicals. Clearly, if Disney is
concerned about the chemical contami-
nants in its products, it would impose on
their licensees a chemical policy which
protects children.

LEGAL POLLUTION

Existing legislation on chemicals fails to
prohibit the use of hazardous chemicals
in consumer products. The high levels of
one or other of the hazardous chemicals
found in Disney childrenswear are legally
allowed. Until chemicals legislation is
reformed to make the use of harmful
chemicals in the production of consumer
goods illegal, corporations should take
responsibility for avoiding or substituting
harmful chemicals in their products.
Companies like Marks & Spencer and
Hennes & Mauritz are actively promoting
and implementing substitution.

Despite enquiries by Greenpeace, in
letters from Greenpeace UK to Disney
dated 18th February 2003, 16th May
2003, 20th October and 31st October
20035, Disney have so far not shown any
interest in phasing out and substituting
hazardous chemicals in their products.
Indeed, in a letter to Greenpeace dated

28th October 2003,  Disney confirms
that they react only to legislation, stating:
“We take all comments on this subject
seriously and constantly review our poli-
cies and procedures to make certain that
they continue to be in full conformity
with all relevant legislation.”

GREENPEACE DEMANDS:
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

Common to all the clothes tested by
Eurofins on behalf of Greenpeace are
that they are Disney merchandise with
Disney prints and motifs. Disney places
strict conditions on the use of its copy-
right characters, including the design and
use of colours. It should also ensure haz-
ardous chemicals are not used in prod-
ucts it licences or produces.

When licensing their logo and charac-

ters for use on their products, Disney
should demand that their licensees avoid
the use of hazardous substances or substi-
tute them with safer alternatives. An
examination of Disney’s code of conduct6
reveals that Disney indeed exerts a lot of
control over their licensees, so there
should be no excuse for not making
demands of their licensees on clean pro-
duction standards.

While such voluntary initiatives to
phase out hazardous substances by retail-
ers are to be welcomed and show that
chemical substitution can not only be
achieved, but insisted upon, the inaction
by Disney, and its response to
Greenpeace’s enquiries, shows that only
legislation can ensure that these chemi-
cals are not allowed to be used in the
production of garments.

WHAT IS THE SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE?

The Principle of Substitution states that haz-

ardous chemicals should be systematically

substituted by less hazardous

alternatives or preferably

alternatives for which no

hazards can be identified.

GREENPEACE DEMANDS:
MANDATORY CHEMICAL
SUBSTITUTION

As this report shows, existing legislation
on chemicals fails to prohibit the use of
hazardous chemicals in consumer prod-
ucts. This policy failure is being
addressed in two political forums.

Globally, the 2001 Stockholm Convention
seeks to ban the production and use of
12 identified persistent organic pollutants
(POPs), the “dirty dozen”. They include
10 intentionally produced chemicals,
such as pesticides and PCBs, and two by-
products: cancer-causing dioxins and
furans, released from industries that use
chlorine and from waste incinerators that
burn products containing chlorine.

The Stockholm Convention serves two
main objectives:
- incorporating additional chemicals
and groups of chemicals with POPs
characteristics under the remit of the
Convention.
- banning or phasing out POPs by identi-
fying environmentally safer alternatives.

However, if REACH is to provide an

effective means of protection against
harmful chemicals, authorisation should
never be given for the continued use of a
hazardous chemical where a viable, safer
alternative exists. This is the principle of
mandatory substitution. If this principle
is enshrined in EU law we will have
taken a giant step towards ridding our
environment, our homes and our lives of
chemicals that can enter our bodies and
linger there, threatening us with cancer,
genetic damage or any of the other
effects we know they can cause. Until
this happens, consumers are at the
mercy of the chemical producers and
industrial users of chemicals.

Clearly, companies are responding to

increasing consumer awareness of syn-
thetic chemicals in products and some
have policies in place to phase out certain
harmful chemicals and substitute them
with safer alternatives. Disney and other
companies should follow their lead.
However, for ‘mandatory substitution’ to
become comprehensive, institutionalised
and embedded in business decisions,
requires legislation. The global

Stockholm Convention and the
European reform of chemicals policy,
REACH, should provide the legally-
binding structures on which to build a
toxic-free future.

ties make exposure virtually impossible to
control. Even small doses from diverse
sources lead to significant accumulation
of these chemicals in the food chain and
consequently in humans.

The EU is in the process of ratifying
the Stockholm Convention on POPs. It
sees the proposed REACH regulation as
“an appropriate instrument by which to
implement the necessary control meas-
ures on production, placing on the mar-
ket and use of the listed substances and
the control measures on existing and
new chemicals and pesticides exhibiting
persistent organic pollutants character-
istics.” (EU 2004)

Substitution is the

solution to pollution

The success of the Stockholm
Convention in protecting human health
and the environment from hazardous
chemicals will depend on the active
implementation of these broad objec-
tives. By May 2006, parties to the
Stockholm Convention have to draw up
action plans on measures to identify,
characterise and minimise with a view to
eliminating releases of POPs. Article 5 of
the Stockholm Convention requires that:
“The action plan shall promote the develop-

ment and, where it deems appropriate,

require the use of substitute or modified

materials, products and processes to prevent

the formation and release of the chemicals
listed in Annex C” 7

One measure of the effectiveness of the
Convention will be the rate at which new
POPs - besides the ‘dirty dozen’ - are iden-
tified for phase out. Another indicator
will be the effort put into finding safer
substitutes and the adoption of existing
alternatives and substitutes where they
already exist.

In 1998, the European Community
embarked on an ambitious programme to
reform European chemical regulations.
The proposed reform is to be based on a
system of Registration, Evaluation and
Authorisation of CHemicals, known as
REACH. Although the framework of
REACH and the mechanism – authorisa-
tion – is there, as it stands the draft legis-
lation continues with the regulatory para-
digm of ‘adequate control’ for chemicals
of very high concern. The principle of
‘adequate control’ is not one that should
be applied to persistent, bio-accumulative
substances, because their intrinsic proper-

Phthalates were found in all
19 of the Disney garments
analysed in this study. The
levels, expressed as mg
phthalate per kg of printed
section of garment, varied
between 1.4 mg/kg in the
Tigger vest from Denmark
and 200,000 mg/kg in the
Slovak Tigger bib.

The highest level of
phthalates was 320,000
mg/kg found in a PVC
Winnie the Pooh rain jacket
bought in Germany, which

differed from the other products, which
were all woven textiles with printed
motifs.

Analysis of results
The results showed great differences in
the type and amounts of chemicals found
in the samples. The dominant phthalates
found in this investigation were DEHP
(di-ethylhexyl phthalate), BBP (benzyl-
butyl phthalate), DINP (diisononyl phtha-
late) and DHP (diheptyl phthalate).
Other unidentified phthalates were found
in the garment from USA. Some printed
sections of the clothes contained very
high amounts of phthalates, e.g. samples
from Belgium and Slovakia. These gar-
ments are probably printed with the PVC-
based plastisol prints.

Hazards of Phthalates
PVC prints are one of the uses of phtha-
late-plasticized PVC that could lead to
long periods of direct skin contact in chil-
dren, plus the potential for inhalation and
even ingestion of additional quantities.
They are a large group of chemicals. The
phthalates examined in this study include:

Phthalates in clothes find their way to the

environment when the consumers wash their

clothes. Phthalates are washed out and enter

the environment via water treatment plants or

via sewage sludge (Danish EPA 1998).

Phthalates have long been recognised as one

of the most abundant and widespread man-

made environmental contaminants, resulting in

widespread and continuous exposure to

phthalates. Phthalates are relatively persistent,

especially in soils and sediments.  Direct

exposure to phthalates in textiles can occur

during normal wear.

DBP, BBP, DEHP, DINP, DIDP and DEP.
(For full results see Annex B)

DEHP is still the most widely used
phthalate in Europe. DEHP constitutes
about 30% of the market for plasticizers
in Western Europe (EC, 2004). It is a
known reproductive toxin, interfering
with testes development in mammals
(Part et al. 2002), and is classified in the
EU as “toxic to reproduction” (EU
2003a). Similarly, DBP (dibutyl phthalate)
is classified in the EU as “toxic to repro-
duction” (EU 2003a). Very recent
research suggests possible effects on
human sperm development for a break-
down product of DEP, diethyl phthalate
(Duty et al. 2003), widely used in cosmet-
ics and perfumes and, until now, consid-
ered to be of relatively little toxicological
significance.

Substantial concerns exist among sci-

entists with regard to the toxicity of
phthalates to wildlife and humans,
although the precise mechanisms and lev-
els of toxicity vary from one compound
to another. In many cases, it is the
metabolites of the phthalates which are
responsible for the greatest toxicity
(Dalgaard et al. 2001 and Ema, M. &
Miyawaki, E. 2002). With respect to
humans, although substantial exposure
can occur through contaminated food
(the CSTEE has also highlighted con-
cerns relating to secondary poisoning,
i.e. the build up of phthalates through
the food chain), direct exposure to
phthalates from consumer products
and/or medical devices is likely to be
very significant. Perhaps the best-known
example is the exposure of children to
phthalates used in soft PVC teething toys
(Stringer et al. 2000), now subject to
emergency controls within Europe
(see Existing Controls).

Phthalates & body burden
Because of their extensive use in building
materials and household products, phtha-
lates are common contaminants in indoor
air (Otake et al. 2001, Wilson et al. 2001).
They have also been reported as substan-
tial components of house dust, in some
cases at more than 1 part per thousand
(1g/kg) of the total mass of dust (Butte
and Heinzow 2002; Santillo et al. 2003).
Several recent studies have reported
the presence of phthalates and their pri-
mary metabolites in the human body
(Colon et al. 2000, Blount et al. 2000).
Metabolites of phthalates in the urine indi-
cate a wide exposure of humans to phtha-
lates (Barr et al., 2003; CDC, 2003; Koch
et al., 2003).  A study on premature breast
development (thelarche) in female chil-
dren, aged 6 months to 8 years, found
phthalate esters in 68% of serum samples
from the thelarche patients. The phthalate
esters DEHP and DBP, with the most com-
mon commercial uses, were detected in
the highest concentrations. For those sam-
ples with high concentrations of DEHP,
one of the major DEHP metabolites,
mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP),
was also detected. DEHP was detected in
only 14% of the control samples, and then
only in lower concentrations.

Animal studies show that phthalates

cross the placenta and pass into breast
milk (Dostal et al. 1987; Parmar et al.
1985; Srivastava et al. 1989); therefore,
phthalates can be passed onto developing
foetuses and newborn children via their
mothers. Additionally, children seem to
be more exposed to phthalates than
adults. In the US CDC study, of the seven
urine phthalate metabolites tested, the
highest levels of metabolites for DEHP,
DBP and monobenzylphthalates were
found in the youngest age group tested:
6 - 11-year-old children (CDC 2003).

Uses of phthalates
Phthalates have a wide range of applica-
tions, although by far their greatest use is
as plasticizing (softening) additives in flex-
ible PVC. They are produced in very large
quantities; for example, in Europe,
almost 1 million tons is produced per
year (CSTEE 2001a).

Environmental distribution
of phthalates
The use of phthalates results in large-scale
losses to the environment (both indoors
and outdoors) during the lifetime of
products, and again following disposal,
amounting to thousands of tons per year
across the EU (CSTEE 2001a). Phthalates
in garments find their way into the envi-
ronment during laundering when the
rinse water enters the environment via
water treatment plants or via sewage
sludge (Danish EPA 1998). As a conse-
quence, phthalates have long been recog-
nised as one of the most abundant and
ubiquitous man-made environmental con-
taminants (Mayer et al. 1972) and our
exposure to phthalates is therefore wide-
spread and continuous. Although some
degradation is possible, phthalates are
considered to be relatively persistent,
especially in soils and sediments. They
also have an inherent ability to accumu-
late in biological tissues, although contin-
uous exposure undoubtedly contributes
to tissue levels. Risk assessments, con-
ducted under the EU system, have docu-
mented the widespread distribution of
phthalates in all environmental compart-
ments (e.g. see CSTEE 2001b,c).

Existing controls
At present, there are few controls on the
marketing and use of phthalates, despite
their toxicity, the volumes used and their

propensity to leach out of products
throughout their lifetime. Of the controls
which do exist, probably the best known
is the EU-wide emergency ban on the use
of six phthalates in children’s toys
designed to be chewed - first agreed in
1999 and regularly renewed since then
(EU 2003b). While this ban addressed
one important exposure route (via toys),
exposure from other consumer products,
as well as exposure via PVC medical
devices, remains unaddressed.

Following the conclusion of the EU
risk assessment for DEHP, there are pro-
posals for a ban on uses in certain med-
ical devices and tight restrictions for
other applications, though these remain
under discussion at EU level. No formal
proposals have yet been made for the
other phthalates undergoing assessment
within the EU.

In 1998, the Ministerial Meeting of
OSPAR agreed on the target of cessation
of discharges, emissions and losses of all
hazardous substances to the marine envi-
ronment by 2020 – the “one generation”
cessation target. The phthalates DBP and
DEHP were on the first list of chemicals
for priority action towards this target
(OSPAR 1998). DEHP is also proposed
as a “priority hazardous substance” under
the EU Water Framework Directive (EU
2001), such that action to prevent releas-
es to water within 20 years will be
required throughout Europe, though a
decision on this classification remains
under consideration.

2. ALKYLPHENOL ETHOXYLATES

Alkylphenol ethoxylates were present in
all the Disney clothes tested (17).
Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) were
found at levels ranging from 31 to 1,200
mg/kg printed textile section, octylphe-
nol ethoxylates (OPEs) at levels ranging

SAMPLE

from 1.2 - 650 mg/kg, giving a sum of
alkylphenol ethoxylates in Disney tex-
tile prints of 34.1-1,700 mg/kg
(Eurofins 2003).

Analysis of results
The wide range of concentrations shows
that it is possible to produce textile prints
containing levels of OPEs in the low
mg/kg (ppm) range. The levels of NPEs
were higher, with a maximum of 1,700
mg/kg (0.17% by weight of the printed
textile area). In some of the garments, the
levels of NPEs were lower, at between 49
and 83 mg/kg. Given the toxicity of these
compounds and their breakdown prod-
ucts, possible sources of NPEs and OPEs
in finished textiles clearly require urgent
investigation, with a view to their elimina-
tion from the final products and the
processes used in textile manufacture.

Hazards of Alkylphenols and their
ethoxylates
Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs) are prob-
ably best known for their use in industrial
detergents, though these chemicals, and
the related alkylphenols (which were not
quantified in this study), have many other
commercial applications.

The main hazards associated with
APEs result from their partial degradation
to shorter-chain ethoxylates and to the
parent alkylphenols (APs) themselves (i.e.

nonylphenol and octylphe-
nol), both of which are per-
sistent, bio-accumulative and
toxic to aquatic organisms.
The EU risk assessment for
nonylphenol (NP) identified
significant risks from many
current uses of NPEs, that
included risks to the aquatic
environment, to soil and to
higher organisms through
secondary poisoning (i.e.
resulting from the accumu-
lation of NP in food (EC
2002a).

The most widely recognised hazard
associated with both NPs and octylphe-
nols (OPs), is undoubtedly their estro-
genic activity, i.e. their ability to mimic
natural estrogen hormones. This can
lead to altered sexual development in
some organisms, most notably the femi-
nisation of fish (Jobling et al. 1995,
1996), a factor thought to have con-
tributed significantly to the widespread
changes in fish sexual development and
fertility in UK rivers. Jobling et al.
(2002) and Atienzar et al. (2002) recent-
ly described direct effects of NPs on
DNA structure and function in barnacle
larvae, a mechanism that may be respon-
sible for the hormone disruption effects
seen in whole organisms.

Hazards to human health remain
unclear, although recent studies have
highlighted concerns directly relevant to
humans. For example, Chitra et al.
(2002), and Adeoya- Osiguwa et al.
(2003), describe effects on mammalian
sperm function, while DNA damage in
human lymphocytes has also recently
been documented (Harreus et al. 2002).

Alkylphenols & body burden
There are only a few studies on levels of
human contamination by alkylphenols,
but those that have been performed clear-
ly show that children are contaminated
before and after birth. (Guenther et al.
2002, Takada et al. 1999) Nonylphenol
has been detected in human umbilical
cords (Takada et al. 1999), confirming
that it crosses the placenta from the con-
taminated mother to the growing foetus.
The authors stressed the importance of
further studies using larger numbers of
umbilical cords, and analyses of maternal
and cord blood to estimate the fraction
of contaminants passing from the blood
to the foetus. Nonylphenol also contami-
nates breast milk (Guenther et al. 2002).

Uses of alkylphenols and their
ethoxylates
Alkylphenols (APs) are non-halogenated
chemicals manufactured almost exclusive-
ly to produce alkylphenol ethoxylates
(APEs), a group of non-ionic surfactants.
The most widely used APEs are ethoxy-
lates of nonylphenol (NPEs) and, to a
lesser extent, octylphenol (OPEs). NPEs
have been used as surfactants, emulsifiers,
dispersants and/or wetting agents in a
variety of industrial and consumer appli-
cations. Of the 77,000 tonnes used in
Western Europe in 1997, the share of tex-
tile finishers was 10 % (OSPAR 2001).
APEs are found in industrial detergents,
such as for wool washing and metal fin-
ishing; industrial processes such as emul-
sion polymerisation, leather and textile
finishers and even the spermicidal lubri-
cant nonoxynol-9. Outside Europe, APEs
may also be used in many domestic prod-
ucts, such as in liquid clothes detergents
in the USA. Once released to the environ-

ment, APEs can degrade back to APs,
which are persistent, bioaccumulative
and toxic to aquatic life.

Environmental distribution of alkyl-
phenols and their ethoxylates
Nonylphenol and its derivatives are
widely distributed in fresh and marine
waters and in particular, in sediments, in
which these persistent compounds accu-
mulate. Because of releases to waste-
water, APEs and APs are also common
components of sewage sludge, including
sludge applied to land (Danish EPA
1998). Research into levels in wildlife
remains very limited, although there
have been reports of significant levels in
fish and aquatic birds downstream from
sites of manufacture and/or use of
APEs. Both NP and OP are known to
accumulate in the tissues of fish and
other organisms (OSPAR 2001, EC
2002a). Recent research demonstrated
the widespread presence of NP in a vari-
ety of foods in Germany (Guenther et al.
2002), although the consequences for
human exposure have yet to be fully eval-
uated. The extent and consequences of
direct exposure from use in consumer
products are poorly described, although
both NP and OP residues have recently
been reported as contaminants in house
dust (Butte and Heinzow 2002 and
Santillo et al.2003)

Existing controls
In 1998, the Ministerial Meeting of
OSPAR agreed on the target of cessation
of discharges, emissions and losses of all
hazardous substances to the marine envi-
ronment by 2020 - the “one generation”
cessation target. NP/NPEs were included
on the first list of chemicals for priority
action towards this target (OSPAR 1998).

Since then, NP has been included as a
“priority hazardous substance” under the
EU Water Framework Directive, such
that action to prevent releases to water
within 20 years will be required through-
out Europe (EU 2001). A decision on the
prioritisation of OP/OPEs under the
Directive remains under consideration.
Already, however, the widely recog-
nised environmental hazards presented
by AP/APEs have led to some restrictions
on use. As noted earlier, the risk assess-
ment conducted under the EU system
concluded that, for NPs, there is a need
for further risk reduction in some areas,
although proposals for restrictions on
marketing and use of NP and its deriva-
tives remain under discussion. At the
same time, very little information exists
regarding the ongoing uses of NPs, OPs
and their derivatives in consumer prod-
ucts and, as a consequence, our direct
exposure to them.

µg/kg

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 19 20 21

SAMPLE

Organotins were present in 10 of the
17 Disney products tested for this
chemical group, in concentrations rang-
ing from 4 to 474 µg/kg (microgram/kg)
in printed sections of the woven
garments.

The highest concentration - 1,129
µg/kg - was found in a Winnie the Pooh
PVC raincoat, indicating use of organotin
as a PVC stabiliser.

Analysis of results
Samples from Belgium, Spain, New
Zealand, the Philippines, Argentina,
Thailand, USA and Canada contained
4 - 50 µg total organotins per kg of print-
ed textile area.  Higher concentrations,
474 - 1,129 µg/kg, were found in the
Dutch and the German Disney prints.
Monobutyltin (MBT) and dibutyltin (DBT)
were the substances most frequently found
and at the highest concentrations of all
organotin compounds measured. The
German sample contained greater
amounts of mono-octyltin (MOT) and
dioctyltin (DOT). Tributyltin (TBT)
concentrations ranged from 4 - 12 µg/kg,
possibly reflecting TBT contamination of
other organotin compound preparations
used in the textile production process.

Hazards of Organotins
Organotins are used as stabilisers in PVC.
Textiles containing polymer parts, like
T-shirts with prints, can contain organo-
tin compounds such as butyl- and octyltin
compounds.

Organotins are known to
be toxic at relatively low lev-
els of exposure not only to
marine invertebrates but also
to mammals. In marine
invertebrates, TBT is gener-
ally more toxic than DBT,
which is in turn more toxic
than MBT (Cima et al.
1996). However, this is by
no means always the case, as
DBT is more toxic than TBT
to certain enzyme systems
(Bouchard et al. 1999,
Al-Ghais et al. 2000).

Ariese et al. 1998). Of the few studies
which have been conducted in terrestrial
systems, Takahashi et al. (1999) reported
the presence of butyltin residues in the liv-
ers of monkeys and other mammals in
Japan, as well as in human livers, and sug-
gested that uses in consumer products
may represent an important exposure
route.

Organotins have been demonstrated

to have immunotoxic and teratogenic
(developmental) properties also in mam-
malian systems (Kergosien and Rice
1998), with DBT again frequently appear-
ing more toxic than TBT (De Santiago
and Aguilar-Santelises 1999). DBT is neu-
rotoxic to mammalian brain cells (Eskes et
al. 1999). Ema et al. (1996, 1997) demon-
strated the importance of the precise tim-
ing of exposure to DBT in induction of
defects in developing rat embryos. Very
recently, Kumasaka et al. (2002) have
described toxic effects on testes develop-
ment in mice.

Estimates of the significance of

human exposure to organotins from con-
sumption of contaminated seafood have
taken the potential immunotoxicity of
these compounds to humans as an effect
parameter (Belfroid et al. 2000). While
seafood probably remains the predomi-
nant source of organotin exposure for
many consumers, exposure to consumer
products that contain them or to dusts in
the home may also be significant.

Organotins and body burden
Although organotins, particularly TBT,
have been found in a wide range of mol-

luscs, fish, marine birds, marine mam-
mals, and freshwater birds (IPCS, 1999),
aside from a few reports, levels of con-
tamination in humans are largely
unknown. Takahashi et al. (1999) found
butyltins in human male livers in concen-
trations ranging from 59 - 96 ng/g (with
an average of 79% present as TBT).
Recently Lo et al (2003) found TPT in
human blood in concentrations ranging
from 0.17 – 0.67 mg/L. There are no
readily available reports on child con-
tamination.

Uses of Organotin compounds
There are three major applications for
organotin compounds:

1. TBT in anti-fouling paints for ships,
which, as a result of its widespread
use, has led to changes in sexual
development in marine snails;
2. Triphenyltin (TPT) as a pesticide,

and

3. Butyl- and octyltin compounds as

plasticizer in polymers.

Many textile products containing poly-
mer parts, like T-shirts with prints, sani-
tary bandages, plasters and diapers, can
contain organotin compounds (Gaikema
F.J. et al 1999). In some cases, organotin
compounds are used as fungicides on tex-
tiles that are exposed to extreme weather
conditions, such as canvas or in sports
gear. Although antifouling paints account
for the majority of TBT used, this com-
pound is also used as an antifungal agent
in some consumer products, including
certain carpets, textiles and PVC (vinyl)
flooring (Allsopp et al. 2000, 2001). Most
abundant in consumer products, howev-
er, are MBT and DBT, used as heat sta-
bilisers in rigid (pipes, panels) and soft
(wall-coverings, furnishings, flooring,

toys) PVC products and in certain glass
coating applications (Matthews 1996).
PVC represents about two-thirds of the
global consumption of these compounds
(Sadiki and Williams 1999), which can
comprise up to 2% by weight of the fin-
ished product. According to industry fig-
ures (Ortepa 2004), approximately
15,000 tons of organotins were used in
PVC production in Europe in 1995.

Environmental distribution of organotins

Much of the research describing the envi-
ronmental distribution of organotin com-
pounds has, understandably, focused on
the spread of TBT and its breakdown
products (including DBT) in the marine
environment. The global use of TBT
antifouling paints has resulted in contami-
nation on a global scale. The relative per-
sistence of butyl tins, combined with their
affinity for biological tissues, has led to
their widespread occurrence in fish, seals,
whales and dolphins in all major sea areas
(Kannan et al. 1996; Iwata et al. 1995;
Ariese et al. 1998).

Much less information is available
concerning the distribution of organotins
in other environmental compartments. In
one of the few studies which have been
conducted, Takahashi et al. (1999) report-
ed the presence of butyltin residues in the
livers of monkeys and other mammals in
Japan, as well as in human livers, and sug-
gested that uses in consumer products
may represent an important exposure
route. The presence of organotin com-
pounds in a wide range of construction
and consumer products, especially PVC
products, has already been highlighted. It
has also been recognised for some time

that butyltin plasticizer can migrate from
such products during normal use (Sadiki
and Williams 1999, Santillo et al. 2003).

Existing controls

To date, legislative controls on organotin
compounds have focused primarily on
TBT in antifouling paints. A series of
national bans on its use on small vessels,
starting in France and the UK, was fol-
lowed by an EU wide ban on vessels less
than 25m in length in 1991. (Evans 2000)
More recently, the International
Maritime Organisation (IMO) agreed on
a global phase-out of all TBT applications
(from January 2003) and TBT presence
on ships (from 2008) under its
Convention on Harmful Anti-fouling
Systems (Imo 2004). The first of these
deadlines has recently been transposed
into EU law (EU 2002a). TBT substances
are also “priority hazardous substances”
under the EU Water Framework
Directive (EU 2001), such that action to
prevent releases to water within 20 years
will be required throughout Europe.

At the same time, and despite the tox-
icity to mammals noted above, TBT con-
tinues to be used as an additive in some
consumer products, as do uses of other
butyltins and octyltins. Organotin com-
pounds must not be used for certain tex-
tiles to qualify for an “eco-label” within
the EU (EU 2002b). Otherwise, there are
no restrictions on use, unless the treated
materials or products are used in contact
with water. This is despite the fact that
TBT is classified under the EU’s labelling
Directive as “harmful in contact with
skin, toxic if swallowed, irritating to the
eyes and skin” and as presenting a “dan-

ger of serious damage to health by pro-
longed exposure through inhalation or
if swallowed”.

In 2001, Germany notified the

European Commission of its intention to
introduce stricter controls on organotins,
including controls on use in consumer
products. However, the proposed con-
trols were rejected by the Commission as
“inadmissible” (EC 2002). In 1998, the
Ministerial Meeting of OSPAR agreed on
the target of cessation of discharges,
emissions and losses of all hazardous sub-
stances to the marine environment by
2020 - the “one generation” cessation tar-
get - and included organotin compounds
on the first list of chemicals for priority
action towards this target (OSPAR 1998).
Initially, OSPAR’s action focused on the
achievement of the IMO Convention on

Harmful Anti-fouling
Systems (OSPAR 2000). In
2001, OSPAR began to con-
sider the scope for action on
other uses and other organ-
otin compounds besides
TBT, including the wide-
spread use of butyltin sta-
bilisers, though so far, no fur-
ther measures are proposed.

analysed exhibited concentrations
towards the lower end of this range (i.e.
<10 mg/kg). However, samples from
Belgium and Canada contained lead at
76 and 2,600 mg/kg respectively.

Hazards of Lead
Exposure to this toxic heavy metal can
cause a range of effects including
anaemia and harm to the nervous and
reproductive systems and the kidneys.
The toxic effects of lead are the same,
irrespective of whether it is ingested or
inhaled. The impacts of lead upon the
developing nervous system of children
are of extreme concern, since a perma-
nent lowering of IQ can result. (Nielsen
et al. 2001; ATSDR 2000, Bernard et al.
1995, Goyer 1993) A growing body of evi-
dence suggests that there may be no level
of lead in blood that does not induce a
toxic effect. The developing central nerv-
ous system is considered particularly vul-
nerable (ATSDR 2000, Goyer 1993). The
substance has no known biological func-
tion and is highly toxic to plants, animals
and humans (Danish EPA 1998).

Lead & body burden
Since 1976, the US Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) have been
measuring levels of lead in children’s
blood as part of a large national survey.
The survey shows that for children of 1-5
years old, lead levels were 2.23 micro-
grams per decilitre for the period 1999-
2000. Fortunately blood lead levels are
going down: during the period 1991-1994,
4.4% of 1-5 year olds had more than 10
micrograms of lead per decilitre of blood;
in the period 1999-2000, 2.2% of children
in this age group had lead levels that were

above 10 micrograms per decilitre.
(USDHSS 2003). These decreases show
that public health efforts to reduce chil-
dren’s exposure to lead are improving the
situation. However, children’s exposure
to lead in homes containing lead-based
paint and lead-contaminated dust is still a
serious public health concern.

Uses of lead
Lead and its compounds have many
applications. Every year, many tons of
lead is used in products such as batteries,
in alloys, for lead keels (sailboats), ammu-
nition, in additives to gasoline and in pig-
ments. Lead is also used as a stabiliser in
PVC. In 2002, lead usage was reported as
120,000 tonnes/year, and making up 87%
of the PVC stabiliser market in Western
Europe. (ENDS 2002)

Cadmium was identified in
14 of the 19 garments tested
for this toxic metal at con-
centrations ranging from
0.0069 – 38 mg/kg of print-
ed textile section. The T-
shirt print from Belgium has
a significantly higher con-
tent - 38 mg/kg -  than those
of the other garments.

Environmental distribution of lead
When lead is released into the environ-
ment it has a long residence time, com-
pared with most pollutants, and tends to
accumulate in soils and sediments
(ATSDR 2000, Alloway 1990). Lead is
an element and therefore cannot be
destroyed, only converted from one form
to another.

Existing Controls
In the EU, industry has a voluntary agree-
ment to phase out lead stabilisers; 15% by
2005, 50% by 2010, 100% by 2015. Lead
stabilisers have already been phased out
in Sweden. Denmark recently imposed a
wide-ranging ban on the import, market-
ing and manufacture of lead and prod-
ucts containing lead (MEE 2000).

Alternatives are available; e.g.
calcium-zinc based or organic stabilisers
(ENDS 2003).

Cadmium is a heavy metal
which is highly toxic to
plants, animals and humans,
having no known biochemi-
cal function (ATSDR 2000, WHO 1992).
It is toxic at very low levels of exposure,
and has both acute and chronic effects
on health and the environment.

Cadmium is persistent in the envi-
ronment, with a residence half-life of 10-
30 years. In aquatic environments, how-
ever, cadmium compounds can be more
mobile than most other metals (ATSDR
2000). When present in bio-available
forms, cadmium is able to bio-accumu-
late in many aquatic and terrestrial
organisms. Cadmium especially accumu-
lates in the kidneys and kidney damage
is probably the critical effect (Nordic
Council of Ministers 2003).

Accumulation of cadmium in the
food chain has important implications for
human exposure (ATSDR 2000). The
International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) and the US Department
of Health and Human Services both clas-
sify cadmium and cadmium compounds
as carcinogenic to humans (USDHHS
2000 and IARC 1994).

Other targets of cadmium toxicity are
the bones, where cadmium accumulation
can result in osteoporosis, or osteomala-
cia (softening of the bones) (WHO 1992,
ATSDR 2000). In addition, cadmium
appears to play a role in the development
of hypertension (high blood pressure)
and heart disease (ATSDR 2000, Goyer
1996 and Elinder & Jarup 1996).

Cadmium & body burden
Since 1976, US Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) have
been measuring levels of cadmium in chil-
dren’s blood as part of a national survey.
Blood cadmium levels for children 1-11
years old are not reported since the pro-
portion of results below limit of detec-
tion was too high to provide a valid result.
2135 persons in the age 12-19 had an aver-
age of 0,333 micrograms per decilitre of
blood. 4200 persons in the age 20 years
and older have an average of 0,468 micro-
grams of cadmium per litre of blood
(USDHSS 2003).

Uses of cadmium
Cadmium and its compounds are also
used in metal plating, in pigments for
glasses and plastics, as a stabiliser in
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and as a com-
ponent of various alloys (ATSDR 2000,
Nordic Council of Ministers 2003).
Cadmium compounds are used as stabil-

ising agents in PVC, to provide long-term
weathering, heat and UV resistance to
prolong the life of a product. (OSPAR
2002). Recent data derived from cadmi-
um flows in the EU for around the year
2000 indicate that 300-350 tonnes of cad-
mium were used in pigments and 150
tonnes in stabilisers per year (EC 2002).

Environmental distribution
of cadmium
Accumulation of cadmium in the food
chain has important implications for
human exposure (ATSDR 2000) and The
International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) and the US Department
of Health and Human Services both cate-
gorise cadmium and cadmium com-
pounds as carcinogenic to humans (USD-
HHS 2000 and IARC 1994). Waste dis-
posal is expected to be a major anthro-
pogenic source of cadmium releases to
the environment. The most effective
means of reducing the cadmium content
of waste flows is to remove it from the
goods which will in due course become
waste (OSPAR 2000).

In 1998, the Ministerial Meeting of
OSPAR agreed on the target of cessation
of discharges, emissions and losses of all
hazardous substances to the marine envi-
ronment by 2020 - the one generation
cessation target - and included cadmium
compounds on the first list of chemicals
for priority action towards this target
(OSPAR 1998).

A number of EC directives restrict
the marketing of products containing
cadmium. The use of cadmium and its
compounds is prohibited for product sur-
face treatment, as well as for colouring or
plastic stabiliser agents in a wide range of
products (including PVC) where the cad-

mium content exceeds 0.01 %, with some
exceptions for safety reasons (Directive
76/769/EEC, as amended by Directive
91/338/EEC).

Furthermore, batteries and accumu-

lators containing more than 0.025 %
cadmium by weight or more than 0.4 %
lead by weight are also prohibited under
EC Directive 91/157/EEC. The current
revision of the EU battery waste direc-
tive is looking to tackle hazardous mate-
rials in batteries, including cadmium,
lead and mercury.

The EU Directives on End-of-Life
Vehicles (Directive 2000/53/EC) and
Waste from Electrical and Electronic
Equipment/Restriction of Hazardous
Substances (Directives 2002/96/EC
and 2002/95/EC respectively) ban the
use of lead, cadmium and other sub-
stances in new cars and electronics,
with some exemptions.

National legislation of some member

states places more stringent restrictions
on the use of cadmium in products. In
Sweden, cadmium is in principle only per-
mitted for use in certain batteries. Bans
exist for its use in surface treatment, as
stabiliser and colouring agent. Products
that have been surface-treated with cad-
mium are not allowed to be imported.
Common consumer batteries must not
contain more than 0.025 % cadmium by
weight. (Förordning (1998:944) om för-
bud m.m. i vissa fall i samband med
hantering, införsel och utförsel av
kemiska produkter.1998-06-25, Swedish
Government) Denmark has similarly wide
ranging restrictions on the use of cadmi-
um in surface treatments, and as stabiliser
and colouring agents above 0.0075 % by
weight, and in batteries and accumulators
above 0.025 % by weight. (Statutory
order No. 1199 af 23/12/1992)

Formaldehyde can enter the
body through skin and by
eye contact, inhalation and digestion.
Although it does not accumulate in the
body, acute exposure can cause various
effects, such as allergic asthma in sensitive
individuals. Formaldehyde is a relatively
strong contact allergen, prompting con-
tact allergy in humans who have been in
contact with products that contain less
than 1 % formaldehyde (Danish EPA
2004). The substance is acutely toxic and
is suspected of causing cancer (Danish
EPA, 2001). The International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) has conclud-
ed that there is sufficient evidence for car-
cinogenicity in experimental animals and
has classified formaldehyde as a probable

Uses of formaldehyde
In textiles, formaldehyde is used to pro-
duce easy-care textiles and for fixation of
colours. Cross-linking agents used in tex-
tile printing are also possibly diffuse
sources of formaldehyde release (Danish
EPA 2004a). Formaldehyde is used in vari-
ous steps in textile production. Due to its
volatility, formaldehyde can be trans-
ferred readily from treated to previously
untreated garments.

Environmental distribution and
hazards of formaldehyde
Formaldehyde is very biodegradable and
hence the potential for accumulation in
aquatic organisms is considered to be

low. Data of effects to aquatic organisms,
obtained from the IUCLID register, are
in the range 2 mg/L (Daphnia magna, 48
h) to 74 mg/l (Scenedesmus quadricau-
da, 8 d) (Danish EPA, 2001).

Existing controls

Formaldehyde is listed as a dangerous sub-
stance, in annex 1 of Council Directive
67/548/EEC. Here formaldehyde is clas-
sified as toxic, R23/24/25 (by inhalation,
in contact with skin and if swallowed),
corrosive, R34 (causes burns), Carc3, R40
(possible risk of irreversible effects) and
R43 (may cause sensitization by skin con-
tact) (Danish EPA 2001).

SAMPLE MATERIAL

On 2 December 2003, the Eurofins labo-
ratory (Smedeskovvej 38, DK-8464
Galten) received 17 samples of Disney
clothing. An additional two samples were
delivered on 3 and 4 December 2003. On
receipt the samples were identified with
continuous numbers from 1 to 16 and
from 19 to 21. The samples were stored at
room temperature until analysis. The
sample preparation and analysis were
carried out during the period 4 – 23
December 2003.

So what chemicals did the

independent Danish

Laboratory Eurofins find?

A N A L Y T I C A L   M E T H O D S

SAMPLE PREPARATION

The print was cut out as a right-angled
square from every piece of textile. Since
the thickness of the textiles and the prints
were different, the weight/area ratio was
determined for all samples. The samples

were cut into pieces of 3-4 mm and
mixed thoroughly. Part samples of the
mixed sample were taken as representa-
tive as possible for the following analyses.

DETERMINATION OF PHTHALATES

Dichloromethane was added to the sam-
ple, shaken for 2 hours, and left to stand
at room temperature for 16 hours. A part
sample of the extract was analysed direct-
ly at combined gas chromatography and
mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The quan-
tification is performed using external
standards where possible.

PHTHALATES:

Uncertainty: 10-15%RSD
The limit of detection: 1-10 mg/kg

Determination of alkylphenol ethoxylates
The sample is extracted with methanol
and an aqueous ammonium acetate solu-
tion. The extract is analysed with com-
bined high performance liquid chro-
matography and mass spectrometry with
positive mode electro spray ionization
(LC/MS). The analyses include the octyl-
and nonylphenol ethoxylates from 3 to 15
ethoxy groups. The analyses are per-
formed as true double determinations.

Uncertainty: 10-15%RSD

The limit of detection: 0.2 mg/kg

DETERMINATION OF ORGANIC TIN
COMPOUNDS

The sample is extracted with acetic acid
in methanol. After filtration and addition
of an aqueous media, the tin compounds
are derivatised with sodium tetraethylbo-
rate, and transferred to n-pentane by the
means of extractive derivatisation. The

pentane phase is added isooctane, con-
centrated and analysed with combined
gas chromatography and mass spectrom-
etry (GC/MS) at selective ion monitoring
of the specified tin organic compounds.
The content is quantified versus relevant
standards.

Uncertainty: 10-15%RSD

The limit of detection:

Monobutyltin (MBT):  0.005 mg/kg
Dibutyltin (DBT):  0.003 mg/kg
Tributyltin (TBT):  0.002 mg/kg
Triphenyltin:  0.005 mg/kg
Monooctyltin:  0.010 mg/kg
Dioctyltin:  0.005 mg/kg
Tricyclohexyltin:  0.010 mg/kg

DETERMINATION OF FORMALDE-
HYDE

The sample is extracted with deminer-
alised water. Accordingly the formalde-
hyde reacts with Hantzsch-reagent during
formation of 3,5-diacetyl-1,4-dihydro-
lutidin that is quantified spectro-
photometrically.

Uncertainty: 10-15%RSD

The limit of detection: 20 mg/kg

Determination of cadmium and lead
The sample is digested using nitric acid.
The extract is filtered and the dissolved
amounts of specified metals are deter-
mined with combined Inductively
Coupled Plasma and mass detection
(ICP/MS).

LEAD:

Uncertainty: 10%RSD

The limit of detection: 0.05 mg/kg

CADMIUM:

Uncertainty: 10%RSD

The limit of detection: 0.005 mg/kg
