Roadmap to Recovery:The world’s last intact Forest landscapes!Greenpeace/Behringcontents:Executive summary 5Introduction9Tropical Latin America11Patagonia14Africa 16South Asia Pacific19North America22Europe25Northern Asia28What can be done?31Methodology33Executive summary We are destroying the world’s precious ancient forests at an unprecedented rate.An area of natural forest the size of a football pitch is cut down every two seconds.Half of the forest lost in the last 10,000years has been destroyed in the last 80years and half of that destruction has takenplace since the mid 1970s.Forest loss has a direct link to loss of biodiversity.The current extinction rate ofplant and animal species is around 1,000times faster than in pre-human times – andthis will increase to 10,000 times faster by2050.Scientists predict that the Earth isentering the sixth major extinction event inits history.This is the first one to occurbecause of human activity.Until now,world maps have not been sufficiently accurate or consistent to revealwhich forest areas remain intact,whichhave been damaged and to what extent.Thishas made it difficult to see which forestareas are most in need of protection.Greenpeace has created a new map of theworld’s forests,based on the most up todate,high-resolution satellite imagery and aconsistent set of criteria.It shows us theremaining large forest areas and lets uscompare them directly and accurately,forthe first time.This ground breaking research shows thatthe world’s remaining ancient forests are incrisis and that fewer intact forest landscapes than previously thought are left.To save them,we must act now.Damage to ancient forests is not just abouttotal deforestation.It is also about thedegradation of forest to a point at which itis no longer a viable habitat for its plantand animal species.In the tropics alone,over 5 million square kilometres of foresthave been degraded by destructive loggingand a further 3.5 million square kilometreshas been totally deforested during the lastfew decades.Only intact forest landscapes of severalthousands of square kilometres are largeenough to sustain healthy populations ofmany larger forest animals.They are alsobetter able to adapt to the changing globalclimate.5Greenpeace has created a new map of the world’s forests,based on themost up to date,high-resolution satellite imagery and a consistent set ofcriteria.It shows us the remaining large forest areas and lets us comparethem directly and accurately,for the first time!Greenpeace/NovisTo preserve these last intact forests and the biodiversity they support,we must protectlarge,unbroken areas from further industrial exploitation.The moment a road or pipeline isbuilt the forest and its precious balance of interdependent species begins to be destroyed.These maps are a starting point for monitoring these last large forests landscapes now andin the future and are the baseline for a roadmap to recovery.World governments can use these maps to identify which forest areas are most in need ofprotection and to fast track setting up a global network of protected forest areas.Summary of findings:•Less than 10 percent of the planet’s land area remains as intact forest landscapes.•82 countries out of 148 countries lying within the forest zone have lost all their intact forest landscapes.The majority of the world’s last remaining intact forest landscapes consist oftwo major forest types - tropical rainforest and boreal forest.•49 percent are the tropical forests of Latin America,Africa and Asia Pacific.•44 percent are the great boreal forests of Russia,Canada and Alaska.6World governments can use these maps to identify which forest areas aremost in of protection and to fast track setting up a global network of protected forest areas7The proportion of the remaining intact forest landscapes of the world arelocated as follows:•35 percent are in Latin America.The Amazon rainforest is mainly located in Brazil,which clears a larger area of forest annually than any other country in the world.•28 percent are in North America.North America destroys 10,000 square kilometres of ancient forests every year.Many of the fragmented forests of southern Canada and the United States lack adequate travel corridors and functioning ecosystems for large mammals.•19 percent are in Northern Asia.Northern Asia is home to the second largest boreal forest in the world.The Siberian tiger once roamed across huge areas of Northern Asia but today it can only be found ina small area of intact forest near the Sea of Japan.Only 400 remain in the wild,with twice as many in zoos.•7 percent are in South Asia Pacific. The Paradise Forests of Asia Pacific are being destroyed faster than any other forest on Earth.Much of the large intact forest landscapes have already been cut down,72% in Indonesia and 60% in Papua New Guinea.•8 percent are in Africa.Africa has lost most of its intact forest landscapes in the last 30 years.The timber industry is responsible for destroying huge areas of intact forest landscapes and continues to be the single largest threat to these areas.•Less than 3 percent are in Europe. In Europe,more than 150 square kilometres of intact forest landscapes fall victim to the chainsaw every year and the last areas of the region’s intact forest landscapes in European Russia are shrinking rapidly.283519783Latin AmericaNorthern AsiaAsia PacificAfricaEuropeNorth AmericaPercentage of intact forest landscapes that are strictly protected:Europe  15.5 South East Asia  12 Africa  8.7 North America  6.7 Patagonia32Tropical Latin America  8 Northern Asia 4.4 Overall, only 8 percent of the world’s remaining intact forest landscapesare strictly protected.To save the world’s remaining intact forest landscapes,Greenpeace is calling on governments to:•establish moratoria on new industrial developments in all intact forest landscapes.•set up a global network of protected forest areas encompassing all forests with a high conservation value while the moratoria are in place.This must involve local stakeholders and the prior informed consent of indigenous peoples and other local communities.•ban forest products that come from illegal or destructive sources.•ensure sufficient financial resources for conservation and cut subsidies that threaten forests.For more information and references:www.greenpeace.org/forestmapsFor high resolution maps and a detailed methodology:www.intactforests.org8Overall,only 8 percent of the world’s remainingintact forest landscapes are strictly protectedIntroductionForests are vital to the future of life.They are home to two thirds of all known species ofland plants and animals and to thousands of indigenous peoples that rely on them forfood,water and other basic materials.They also play a key role in regulating local andglobal climates.We are destroying forests at an unprecedented rate.An area of natural forest the size of a football pitch is cutdown every two seconds.Half of the forestlost in the last 10,000 years was destroyedin the last 80 years and half of thatdestruction took place over the last 30years.When we destroy forests,we also eliminatethe diversity of life they support.The lossand fragmentation of intact forest habitatsis the main reason why many plant and animal species are threatened with extinction.Larger animals,such as primates,are particularly vulnerable to forest loss because they usually need agreater roaming and feeding area to survive.The current extinction rate of plant and animal species is approximately 1,000 timesfaster than it was in pre-human times.Scientists predict that the Earth is enteringthe sixth major extinction event in its history and say that extinction rates willfurther increase 10 fold by the year 2050.Biologists believe ancient forests containvast numbers of undiscovered species.Thesetoo could be driven to extinction before weeven find them.This biological catastrophethreatens all life,including our own.To protect the world’s remaining ancientforests,world governments must urgentlyestablish moratoria on new industrial developments in intact forest landscapes.The moratoria must stay in place until theyinstigate proper conservation plans basedon a global network of protected forestareas.9To protect the world’s remaining ancient forests,world governments musturgently establish moratoria on new industrial developments in intact forestlandscapes.The moratoria must stay in place until they instigate properconservation plans based on a global network of protected forest areas!Greenpeace/NovisWhy are intact forest landscapes important? Ancient forests provide a home to an incredible diversity of plant and animal life.Orang-utans,eagles,wolves,jaguars,bears,gorillas,elephants,tigers,birds,deer,frogs,orchids,insects and,last but not least,trees - from saplings to old giants.Ancient forests also provide food,shelter,medicine,clean air and water.They make soil andslopes stable and mitigate droughts,floods and other disasters.It is crucial to protect and preserve forests in large,intact landscapes because they are lessvulnerable to threats beyond their boundaries,such as the invasion of alien species as wellas to drought,loss of humidity and the resultant risk of fire.Only intact forest landscapes of several thousands of square kilometres are large enough tosustain healthy populations of many larger forest animals.Their flora and fauna is betterable to survive natural disturbances such as fires and storms.Large forest areas are alsobetter able to adapt to the changing global climate.ThreatsThe key threats to forest ecosystems and ancient forests in particular are:– destructive and illegal logging– forest clearing for agriculture and pasture– road building and other infrastructure such as new settlements,pipelines and navigable waterways – mining for metals,petroleum and natural gas– damming for hydropower– excessive removal of vegetation (firewood,building materials,overgrazing)– over-hunting and the bush meat trade– climate changeThe root causes of these threats include unsustainable consumption of wood,paper andother forest products as well as increased demand for agricultural products such as meat,soya and palm oil.In many countries,most of the land is controlled by a few rich people.This drives poor people deeper and deeper into previously inaccessible forest.In addition,perverse energy,transport,logging and agricultural policies create incentives to destroy forests,for instancein the form of public subsidies for road building,agriculture,mining or forestry.Corruption,lack of governance and lack of enforcement of forest related laws allows illegaland destructive logging to thrive.Apart from indiscriminately destroying the forest,illegaland destructive logging brings exploitation and deprivation to local communities.It alsoundercuts the price of legally and responsibly logged timber,making responsible forest management less viable.At the Earth Summit of the United Nations in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,governments fromaround the world agreed to conserve biological diversity (Convention on BiologicalDiversity) and combat dangerous climate change.Ancient forests are crucial for both.They are home to most land based species and they prevent significant amounts of carbonfrom being released to the atmosphere and thus contributing to climate change.The world’s remaining intact forest landscapes and the biodiversity they support havereached crisis point,but it is not too late to save them.10Corruption,lack of governance and lack of enforcement of forestrelated laws allows illegal and destructive logging to thriveThe seven major forest regions:Tropical Latin America!Greenpeace/Monk!Greenpeace/Mantegna!Greenpeace/Mantegna!Greenpeace/Pantoja1134 percent of world’s intact forest landscapesare in tropical Latin America,the world’slargest forest regionKey findings:•31 percent of the tropical Latin American forest zone remains as intact forest landscapes.•34 percent of world’s intact forest landscapes are in tropical Latin America,the world’s largestforest region.•Over 55 percent of all intact forest landscapes in tropical Latin America are in Brazil.•11 tropical Latin American countries have destroyed all of their intact forest landscapes (The Bahamas,Dominica,El Salvador,Guadeloupe,Haiti,Jamaica,Martinique,Puerto Rico,Trinidad and Tobago,St.Lucia and Uruguay).•Less than 10 percent of forests across 8 tropical Latin American countries remain as intact forestlandscapes (Nicaragua,Costa Rica,Honduras,Guatemala,Argentina,Mexico,Dominican Republic and Cuba).•Only 8 percent of intact forest landscapes in tropical Latin America are strictly protected.•Over 95 percent of all intact forest landscapes in tropical Latin America are in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest biome.12Tropical Latin AmericaPatagonia (page 14)MexicoPeruPanamaBrazilBoliviaArgentinaChile!Greenpeace/NovisThe Amazon basin in Latin America is thelargest tropical rainforest in the world. Tothe north-west, it stretches into the CentralAmerican rainforests and mountain forests,to the south-east into the Atlantic rainforestand tropical dry forests and woodlands. Tothe south, it reaches the Yunga mountainforests on the eastern slopes of the Andes.One fifth of the world´s fresh water runsthrough the Amazon’s river system andapproximately half of all land based plantsand animals live in its rainforest. TheAmazon is the last refuge for the jaguar,which lives in the tropical rainforests ofSouth and Central America and has recorded ranges of up to 800 kilometres. The Amazon is also home to millions of people, including indigenous peoples such asthe Deni in Brazil, whose tribes have livedin close harmony with the forest for thousands of years. Their lives are destroyedalong with the animals and plants when theforest is cut down. Most of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil,which clears a larger area of forest annuallythan any other country in the world. 13In 2005,after pressure from Greenpeace,local communities and other organisations,50thousand square kilometres of Amazonian rainforest were protected in the Terra do Meioregion of Para state in Brazil.These new reserves represent one of the biggest global conservation achievements.This is because they connect to forests that were already protected,including indigenous lands.!Greenpeace/Beltra!Greenpeace/Hungria!Greenpeace/BeltraMost of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil,whichclears a larger area of forest annually than anyother country in the worldThe seven major forest regions:Patagonia!Greenpeace/Beltra!Greenpeace/Beltra!Greenpeace/Beltra!Greenpeace/Beltra14In 2004,plans to flood 100 square kilometres ofPatagonian rainforest to build a dam for Canadianaluminium giant,Noranda,were put on hold following a campaign by Greenpeace and otherorganisations.The second largest coastal temperate rainforest inthe world stretches across Patagonia in southernSouth America,from the Pacific coast of southernChile up to the Andean mountains and over the border into southern Argentina.Isolated from other major forest regions by theAndes and the Pacific,this forest has evolved a unique and diverse spectrum of species such assouthern beeches,monkey puzzle trees and alerce,asouthern relative of the Californian redwood tree,many of which are more than a thousand years old.Destructive and illegal logging and timber plantations have fragmented and degraded most ofthis forest,especially in the coastal lowlands andthe north.The remaining intact forest landscapesare mostly in the southern mountains.Patagonia’s forests are home to the Darwin frog,the Chilote fox and the Andean deer,which used toroam from the coast to the high mountains.Now itcan only be found at remote,high altitudes between3,300 and 5,000 metres and only a few thousanddeer are left.These forests are also home to indigenous communities,such as the Pehuenche and Mapuche,who have long depended on the natural forestwealth for their way of life.Key findings:•34 percent of the Patagonian forest zone remains as intact forest landscapes.•Less than 1 percent of the world’s last intact forest landscapes are in Patagonia. •82 percent of Patagonia’s intact forest landscapes are in Chile, 18 percent in south Argentina.•32 percent of the intact forests are strictly protected. •Over 89 percent of all intact forest landscapes in Patagonia are in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biome.

orang-utans remainedand these are in protected areas too smallfor their long-term survival.In 2003,Greenpeace and its partners helpedindigenous communities (the customarylandowners) throw a Malaysian companyinvolved in illegal logging,off their land in western Papua New Guinea.Greenpeace is now supporting the communities’efforts to move towards eco-forestry and to holdthe company,Concord Pacific (a subsidiary ofSamling),to account for the damage it caused.The company is facing charges in the PapuaNew Guinea court for trespassing during its illegal logging activities.The forests of South Asia Pacific stretch fromthe Himalayas and China in the north,throughthe Paradise Forests (Indonesia,Papua NewGuinea and the Solomon Islands) and toTasmania and New Zealand in the south.Thisincredibly diverse region supports hundreds ofindigenous cultures and creatures found nowhereelse in the world,such as 38 species of the exotic bird of paradise found on the island ofNew Guinea.Roughly half of the animals found on this islandare unique to the region and hundreds of newspecies have recently been discovered there,including the rediscovered Berlepsch´s six-wiredbird of paradise and the golden-mantled treekangaroo.Millions of people live under these forestcanopies and enjoy a relationship with theforests that we cannot even imagine.The culturaldiversity of these communities is astonishing.More than 1,000 languages are spoken in NewGuinea alone - one sixth of all the languagesspoken on Earth.While Brazil clears a larger area of forest annually,the Paradise Forests are beingdestroyed faster than any other on Earth.Much of the large intact forest landscapes havealready been destroyed – 72 percent inIndonesia and 60 percent in Papua New Guinea.In Papua New Guinea,58

every yearIn 2006,following a decade of campaigning by Greenpeace,other non-government organizations andindigenous peoples,the government of the west Canadian province of British Columbia pledged toensure protection of 20,000 square kilometres of the Great Bear Rainforest and to dramaticallyimprove logging practices in the rest of the forest.More than 10,000 square kilometres of NorthAmerican ancient forests are clearcut every year.This affects the future of forest dependent plantsand animals,among them grizzly bear,puma,woodland caribou and grey wolf.The wolf wasonce one of the most widespread mammals onEarth.The North American wolf population hasbeen decimated by hunting and habitat destruction over the last two hundred years.Many of the fragmented forests of southernCanada and the United States,with the exception of Alaska,lack adequate travel corridors and functioning ecosystems for largemammals.Forest destruction also affects the livelihoods ofindigenous peoples such as the Haida of HaidaGwaii island on the Canadian west coast,andthe Innu of the east Canadian province ofQuebec.Canada has one million indigenous people.80 percent live in forest-based communities and depend on the forest for theirlivelihoods and cultural sustenance.24!Greenpeace/Warford!Greenpeace/CalhounThe seven major forest

region.Tothe south and the east,the forest stretches intotemperate forests.The Russian taiga (borealconiferous forest) thrives even at temperaturesof minus 50 degrees Celsius.In spite of theextreme conditions,countless fungi,ferns,lichensand mosses grow there.Spanning thousands of kilometres,the landscapes change from tundra,with stuntedwillows and birches in the far north to denseconiferous,broadleaved and mixed forests in thesouth.Even large animals,such as elk,brownbear,lynch and the Siberian Tiger in the south-east,can find enough food in these vastareas.The Siberian Tiger once roamed acrosshuge areas of Northern Asia but today it canonly be found in a small area of intact forestnear the Sea of Japan.Only 400 remain in thewild,with twice as many in zoos.Like other forest regions,the snow forests ofNorthern Asia are also home to hundreds ofindigenous peoples.The diversity of plant andanimal species is greater in the region’s southernrainforests between the Amur River and the Seaof Japan,than in the larch forests of the northpart of the region.The threat of illegal anddestructive logging is also greater in the souththan the north,and is increasing with the expansion of the timber trade from Russia toChina,Japan and Korea.Greenpeace helped protect 195,000 square kilometres of Siberian wilderness by pushing for them tobe listed as UNESCO World Heritage

than previously thought are left.To save them,we must act now.Protected AreasToday,only 8 percent of the world’s intactforest landscapes are in strictly protectedareas.To preserve these last intact forestsand the biodiversity they support,we mustprotect large,unbroken areas from furtherindustrial exploitation.The moment a roador pipeline is built the forest and its precious balance of interdependent speciesbegins to be destroyed.Empowerment of LocalCommunitiesOver one billion people worldwide rely onintact forests for their daily survival.Livingin thousands of small communities either inthe forests or on their edges,they rely on itfor the basics of life - food,medicine andbuilding materials.Because they live in harmony with the forest and depend on it,they are also the main guardians of the forest.In many forested areas,such indigenouscommunities have rights under law to protect their land from logging companiesthat decimate their environment and theirlives.Yet,these communities are ill equippedto take on the huge corporations behind theloggers.Greenpeace works closely with forest communities to help them make a livingfrom the forest without destroying it,and toreduce the pressure on them to hand theirforest land over to destructive logging companies.It is also helping to identify,mark out and map the boundaries of communities’territorial land,a key tool thathelps establish their rights over their tribalterritories so they can protect the forests.Responsible ForestManagementDamage to ancient forests is not just abouttotal deforestation.It is also about thedegradation of forest to a point at which itis no longer a viable habitat for its plantand animal species.In the tropics alone,over 5 million square kilometres of foresthave been degraded by destructive loggingand a further 3.5 million square kilometreshas been totally deforested during the lastfew decades.Clearcutting and other formsof destructive logging have also damagedand degraded large areas of boreal andtemperate forests.Logging companies often try to get aroundenvironmental laws by promising that theywill only harvest a certain number of selected trees from forest areas in whichlocal governments allow limited logging.Inreality,huge machinery thunders throughthe undisturbed forest,crushing and damaging plants and animals in its way,decimating local communities,pollutingwaterways and damaging those trees thatare not cut.The results are devastating - ascarred landscape of isolated trees,unlikelyto survive without their neighbours,and aforest stripped of its plant and animal life.Forests can provide timber without beingdestroyed,using a way of selecting andextracting certain trees without damagingthe surrounding habitat.Responsible forestmanagement is certified under the ForestStewardship Council (FSC).However,FSCcertified forest areas account for only 2 percent of all forests,and destructive and illegal logging is a constant threat to thework of the FSC as well as to the foreststhemselves.This ground breaking research shows that the world’s remainingancient forests are in crisis and that fewer intact forest landscapesthan previously thought are left.To save them,we must act now32A call for ActionGreenpeace is calling on governments to:•establish moratoria on new industrial developments in all intact forest landscapes. •set up a global network of protected forest areas encompassing all forests with a high conservation value while the moratoria are in place. This must involve local stakeholders and the prior informed consent of indigenous peoples and other local communities.•ban forest products that come from illegal or destructive sources.•ensure sufficient financial resources for conservation and cut subsidies that threaten forests.You can also help protect ancient forests:•pressure your government.Demand it stops allowing forest destruction.•call on it to protect the last remaining ancient forests.•ask it to introduce legislation banning imports of illegally and destructively sourced forest products into your country.•only buy "good wood" that is marked with the FSC logo and ask your store to supply FSC timber and paper products.•reduce your consumption of paper,timber and other forest products,particularly disposable products and give preference to recycled paper and other recycled material.•log on to www.greenpeace.org to find out how you can support Greenpeace in its work to protect the world’s remaining ancient forests.What is the FSC?The Forest Stewardship Council, or FSC, is an independent scheme that certifies responsibleharvesting of forests  - and clearly labels the products made out of wood from responsibleforestry.  Set up in 1994, the FSC promotes responsible forestry in over 700,000 square kilometres of forests in 66 countries - and that is expanding ever year.When you buy a timber product carrying the logo of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC),you can be sure it comes from an environmentally appropriate and socially beneficial source.FSC is the only, internationally recognised, forest certification scheme that can give credibleassurance that timber products come from legally and responsibly managed forests. It is alsothe only scheme supported by major environmental groups as well as progressive timber companies and many indigenous people’s organisations.Thank you for reading this information.Ancient forests support all life onEarth.They need our help.Together,we can save them.!Greenpeace/Beltra!Greenpeace/Mauthe33Methodology and Definitions This global map follows a first assessment of intact forest landscapes conducted by theWorld Resource Institute in 1997,”The Last Frontier Forests”.The new Greenpeacemap is more accurate because it is entirely based on the latest available satelliteimagery,which is mostly from 2001 and 2002.It is also based on strict interpretationrules to make the results as globally comparable as possible.1.The forest zone (see below for definition) was identified using existing data based on thelatest available medium resolution satellite data (MODIS) and all areas outside the forest zone (more than half of the world´s land cover) excluded from the assessments.2.Topographic maps showing roads,settlements and other human infrastructure were used to further exclude all areas within the forest zone that has been fragmented to areas smaller 500 square kilometres.3.Only unfragmented areas larger 500 square kilometres - as derived from the topographic information - were subject to fine scale analysis of fragmentation and otherhuman impacts using high resolution satellite imagery (Landsat 7) in order to identify intact forest landscapes (see below for definition).‘Intact forest landscapes’(green in the maps) are defined for the purpose of this global-scale map as blocks of mostly forested,but also non-forested (e.g.swamps),areaslarger 500 square kilometres and a minimum width of 10 kilometres within the forest zonethat show no visible sign of significant human impact (e.g.logging,burning).Excludedfrom these intact forest landscapes were one km buffer zones around human infrastructure(e.g.roads,waterways,settlements) and fire scars in the vicinity of human infrastructurewhere most fire regimes have been significantly altered (e.g.increased fire frequency).It should be noted that some human impact is invisible from space (e.g.small forest roadsand paths or specifically in Central African forests the decline of populations of largemammals as a result of over-hunting).Also smaller scale impacts (e.g.some selective logging) that happened more than 30-70 years ago,depending on the region,often becomeinvisible on satellite imagery or undistinguishable from the natural dynamics of the forest.The most recent human impacts are not shown on this map because the satellite imageryused is,on the average,4-5 years old.All this leads to some – albeit globally insignificant - overestimations of intact forest landscapes despite the one km buffer exclusion zones.Only ground level verification can provide a more accurate local picture inthese areas.‘The forest zone’is defined as areas with a tree canopy cover density of above 20 percent,including areas below 20 per cent tree canopy cover density which are fully surrounded by the forest zone (data from M.Hansen).Ancient forests are defined as forests that are shaped largely by natural events with littleimpact from human activities.These include all intact forest landscapes shown on this map,but also many intact forests appearing under the category ’other forest areas’,becausethey are smaller than 500 square kilometres.‘Other forest areas’(grey in the maps) includes all ancient forests smaller 500 square kilometres.Most of the other forest areas are damaged and degraded forests or are treeplantations.34
