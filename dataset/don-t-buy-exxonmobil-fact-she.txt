ExxonMobil, one of the largest corporations on the planet,
has spent the last decade working to sabotage action onglobal warming. ExxonMobil has spent more than anyother oil company to derail U.S. policy on global warmingand ensure our dependence on fossil fuels.
Scientists say that if global warming, caused by burning
oil, coal and gas, continues unabated, there will be amassive increase in temperatures, storms, floods,droughts and diseases. But ExxonMobil still denies thatburning fossil fuels causes global warming. 
While other energy companies have been investing in
clean, renewable energy sources, ExxonMobil continuesto spend on oil exploration and development while ignor-ing the ramifications of these destructive efforts and itsown responsibility in solving the planet’s largest environmental crisis.
Greenpeace has launched an unprecedented global
campaign to stop ExxonMobil from continuing to corruptU.S. energy policy and the environment. 
Global Warming
Human activity is changing the climate that makes life onEarth possible. The world is becoming warmer due to thebuild up of gases generated by human activities. One ofthe main gases causing global warming is carbon dioxide,
which comes from the burning of fossil fuels—particularlyoil, coal and gas. Global warming not only increases theEarth’s temperature, it also leads to an increase infloods, droughts and wildfires, intensified hurricanes,heat waves, the spread of infectious disease andspecies extinction.
A panel of scientists called the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) is recognized as the mostcredible scientific authority on global warming. TheIPCC’s latest report on climate science (released in2001) found “new and stronger evidence that most ofthe observed warming over the last 50 years is attribut ableDon’t Buy

to human activities.” It found that global warming is
already having a negative impact on the environment.
A small minority of scientists, known as “skeptics,” chal-
lenge climate science. Many of them have been funded byfossil fuel companies, including ExxonMobil. These arescientists who state that global warming is not occurring,is not due to human causes and that warmer tempera-tures will even be beneficial due to shorter winters. It isimportant to note that while these skeptics are often rec-ognized scientists, their views on global war ming have
been discredited by the rest of the scien tific community.
The majority of scientists are not debating whetherhumans are causing global warming, but about the paceand impacts on different parts of the world.
Kyoto Protocol - the global warming treaty
ExxonMobil has spent hundreds of millions of dollars overmore than a decade to undermine meaningful efforts tosolve global warming. While heavily lobbying the U.S. gov-ernment to derail global warming action, the company hasalso funded economic “scare” reports on global warmingpolicy and launched a multi-million dollar advertisingcampaign against ratification of the global warming treaty,the Kyoto Protocol. ExxonMobil’s efforts were finallyrewarded when President Bush announced that theUnited States would be withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol.
The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement among
industrialized nations to reduce emissions of carbon diox-ide and other greenhouse gases that cause global warm-ing. These reductions are legally binding once countriesagree to ratify the treaty. The Kyoto Protocol is a crucialand significant first step towards tackling global warming.
In March 2001, President Bush announced that the U.S.
would not ratify the Kyoto treaty, declaring it dead.Fortunately, the rest of the world refused to let PresidentBush wreck ten years of negotiations on global warmingand continued to move forward to implement the KyotoProtocol—soon to become international law.
However, as the United States is the largest emitter of
global warming pollution, we cannot hope to stop globalwarming unless the U.S. starts taking action to reduce itsglobal warming pollution. That cannot happen untilExxonMobil is held accountable for its blatant interfer ence
with global warming policy. ExxonMobil must be forced tochange its position or be stopped from influencing
government policy.
Dirty Money
ExxonMobil’s contributions to the Republican Party in the2000 election cycle totaled more than $1 million, morethan any other oil company. In 1999 ExxonMobil’s lobby-ing budget, $11.7 million, was the fifth highest in theU.S., outspent only by pharmaceutical and tobacco giants. 
As a result of these efforts, ExxonMobil has enjoyed a
leading role in shaping White House energy policies. Theinfluence of the ExxonMobil agenda is demonstrated by the
follow ing:
• a major role in the pro-drilling Bush/Cheney energy
plan, which would only serve to increase the profits ofExxonMobil and dramatically increase emissions ofglobal warming pollution.
• a request to the Bush administration for the removal of
the head of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange, which has concluded that human activity iscausing global warming.
As an international organization, Greenpeace is working
on a global-scale to Stop ExxonMobil. Our efforts to stopExxonMobil and stop global warming are the culminationof thousands of voices concerned about the future ofour planet.
