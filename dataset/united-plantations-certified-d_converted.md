INTRODUCTION

This Greenpeace investigation conducted by Greenpeace Netherlands (from here on
referred to as “Greenpeace”) reveals that deforestation, deep peat conversion, land
disputes and illegal practices continue to occur in the plantation estates owned by a
company that is RSPO certiﬁ ed for part of its operations.

The ﬁ ndings in this report clearly shows the failure of the company, the RSPO
(Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) and the certiﬁ cation process to tackle the issue
of deforestation. How can it be that United Plantations have received their certiﬁ cation
for plantations in Malaysia, whilst they continue ‘business as usual’ destructive
practices in Indonesia? This shows that the RSPO is failing to enforce even its own
minimum, and from Greenpeace’s point of view, insufﬁ cient criteria.

The certiﬁ ers have ignored several issues including land conﬂ icts, operations in breach
of Indonesian law, development without High Conservation Value assessments and
continued clearance of forests and peatlands, even though some of this land clearing
took place on peat more than 2 m deep and is therefore illegal under Indonesia law.

The granting of the ﬁ rst sustainability certiﬁ cate by the Roundtable on Sustainable
Palm Oil (RSPO) to United Plantations seems little else but a cover up of business-
as-usual including land grabbing, deforestation, peatland conversion, and the violation
of Indonesian law.

To end the rampant deforestation for palm oil urgent action is needed. The RSPO
must implement and toughen up its existing criteria. But voluntary certiﬁ cation
alone cannot be sufﬁ cient to protect the last forests of South-East Asia and help to
tackle climate change.

Greenpeace calls for a moratorium on further deforestation and and peatland
degradation in South-East Asia.

The link between palm oil and deforestation

On November 11th 2008 the industry will celebrate
the arrival of the ﬁ rst batch of certiﬁ ed palm oil in
Europe, meanwhile massive deforestation in
South-East Asia continues. Millions of hectares of
forests have already been converted into palm oil
plantations in the last decade, and the industry
is planning to open up millions of hectares more,
especially in Indonesia.1 In Sumatra the last
remaining primary forests, home to endangered
species such as the orangutan and the Sumatran
tiger are almost gone. The clearing and burning
of forests and peatlands are contributing hugely
to climate change. Indonesia’s Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) emissions from destroyed or degraded
peatlands alone are around 1.8 gigatonnes of CO2
per year,2 equivalent to 4% of the world’s entire
greenhouse gas emissions.3 Peatland destruction
and deforestation makes Indonesia the third
largest emitter of GHGs in the world.4

There is growing pressure on the palm oil industry
to break the link between palm oil, deforestation
and climate change. The industry (producers,
traders, manufacturers and retailers), and some
governments have placed their faith in the RSPO
(Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil) as the
solution to these problems in the palm oil sector.
This voluntary initiative has developed a certiﬁ ca-
tion system for the production of sustainable palm
oil based on a set of principles and criteria,5 which
have taken four years to develop. These include
expecting companies applying for certiﬁ cation to
refrain from clearing primary forests and areas of
High Conservation Value (HCV) within any of their
operations.

These criteria have been criticized by various
environmental NGOs for not stopping the clearing
of vast forest areas, that are still of high signiﬁ cance
for climate protection as carbon stores. The RSPO
principles and criteria also only vaguely limit the
development of plantations on peatlands, even
though these comprise one of the largest carbon
stocks on earth and the protection of these soils is
crucial in the ﬁ ght against climate change.

Whilst the RSPO has made some progress, for
many stakeholders, it is failing on a number of
fronts. In the last twelve months Greenpeace has
produced two reports, ‘Cooking the Climate’ and
‘Burning up Borneo’ both6 of which show that
key RSPO members, who have yet to get their
plantations certiﬁ ed, are actively involved in
rainforest destruction, breaking the spirit of the
RSPO.

But now that companies are actually getting
certiﬁ ed, will this mean a change from business
as usual? Greenpeace has investigated the case
of the ﬁ rst company group certiﬁ ed under RSPO:
United Plantations.

United Plantations
United Plantations (UP) is one of the most
prominent Malaysian oil palm plantation
companies, with a turnover of RM674 million in
2007 (€ 145 million).7 With just under 40,000
hectares (ha) of existing oil palm plantations in
Malaysia, the company now intends to double
its plantation area through the acquisition
of plantation companies near Pangkalanbun in
Central Kalimantan (Indonesia).8

Founded in 1906 by the Danish national Sven
Aage Westenholz, UP is still largely foreign
owned, with the two brothers Martin and
Carl Bek-Nielsen holding the majority of shares
– over 45% each. The Bek-Nielsens are
also major shareholders and on the board of
directors of Aarhus Karlshamn (AAK), based in
Sweden and (according to their own publica-
tions), the world’s leading manufacturer of
high value-added specialty vegetable fat.9

AAK is a major buyer of United Plantation’s
palm kernel oil and related products10, while
United Plantation processes a big part of its
crude palm oil production through its own
Unitata reﬁ nery into edible oils, specialty fats
and soap products. The rest of the oil is sold
on the local market.11 AAK processes palm
kernel oil into a wide range of products, with
a focus on confectionary ingredients.12
It supplies global players including Nestlé and
United Biscuits.13

United Plantations:
the ﬁ rst test case for RSPO ?
In August 2008, United Plantations was the ﬁ rst
company to be certiﬁ ed under RSPO standards.
They were assessed and certiﬁ ed by the Dutch
certiﬁ er Control Union Certiﬁ cation.14 United
Plantations applied for certiﬁ cation of their
Malaysian operations only. United Plantations’
new concessions in Kalimantan are therefore
subject to the RSPO rules for so-called partial
certiﬁ cation.15 According to these rules companies
must ensure that all their operations (including
all of their plantations) meet certain minimum-
criteria (see box).16 NGOs pushed RSPO to adopt
this condition to prevent big company groups from
certifying a show case plantation, while business-
as-usual continues in the other plantations owned
by the group.

What these minimum criteria mean is that even if
only one concession within a company group is
getting certiﬁ ed, all concessions majority owned by
the group must meet these minimum criteria.17
If the company fails to comply with this then
“Certiﬁ cates for all of the company’s holdings shall be
suspended...”.18

In the certiﬁ cation announcement (January 2008),19
United Plantations listed two different majority
held plantation companies in Kalimantan to be
certiﬁ ed at a later stage: PT Surya Sawit Sejati
(“PT SSS1”– 15,650 ha) and PT Sawit Seberang
Seberang (“PT SSS2”- 18,000 ha). The acquisition
of a 95% stake in PT SSS1 had been completed
as of 9th of June 200620. The acquisition of PT
SSS2 was still pending approval by Malaysian and
Indonesian authorities as of May 2008.21

United Plantations committed to ensure that these
two operations are RSPO certiﬁ ed by 2013 and 2016
respectively.22 Full compliance with the minimum
RSPO-criteria for the Indonesian operations of UP
were claimed in an attachment23 to the assessment
announcement.24 The certiﬁ er then conﬁ rmed this
in their ﬁ nal public summary audit in August 2008.25

Minimum criteria
The key minimum-criteria for “partial certiﬁ -
cation” set out in section 4.2.4 of the RSPO
Certiﬁ cation Systems document are:26

•  “a time-bound plan for achieving certiﬁ cation
of all relevant entities. The certiﬁ cation body
will be responsible for reviewing the appropri-
ateness of this plan (in particular, that the time
scale is sufﬁ ciently challenging),....

• no signiﬁ cant land conﬂ icts

•  no replacement of primary forest or any area
containing HCVs [High Conservation Value]
since November 2005

•  no labour disputes that are not being resolved

through an agreed process

•  no evidence of non-compliance with law in any

of the non-certiﬁ ed holdings.“

RSPO certiﬁ ed in Malaysia,
business as usual in Indonesia
In October 2008, Greenpeace investigated the
reality on the ground in Central Kalimantan, using
the RSPO minimum-criteria as a reference –
although we did not investigate labour conﬂ icts.
The results of the Greenpeace study demonstrate
that United Plantations does not comply with any
of the RSPO standards for partial certiﬁ cation
that we investigated. The results show clearly
that United Plantation may have their RSPO
certiﬁ cation of Malaysian plantations but continue
with business as usual in their Indonesian
concessions.

In addition to violating these RSPO minimum
criteria, in Kalimantan United Plantations has
cleared and continues to clear signiﬁ cant forests
that are very important carbon stocks, crucial to
combating climate change.

How United Plantations’ failed to deliver

Check 1:
Time bound plan for full certiﬁ cation

Check 2:
Land conﬂ icts

RSPO’s requirements for partial certiﬁ cation
stipulate that company groups that apply for the
certiﬁ cation of part of their plantations must have
in place adequately ambitious and realistic plans
for the full certiﬁ cation of their other plantations.

In January 2008, in the attachment to the Control
Union announcement of the main assessment,
it is stated that United Plantation’s Indonesian
plantations will be certiﬁ ed within three years
upon the issuance of the ﬁ rst RSPO certiﬁ cate.27
This means that United Plantations Indonesian
plantations should be certiﬁ ed by August 2011.
However, without any further elaboration, the
Control Union audit report28 states that it was
adequately “challenging and realistic” that the
Indonesian estates will only be certiﬁ ed by 2013
and 2016.
The extended time frame is very worrying. A similar
sized United Plantations’ concession in Malaysia
could be certiﬁ ed in 6 months. This seems to
suggest that UP is using its certiﬁ cate for its Malay-
sian plantations just as a showcase. While speedily
getting their older, largely developed Malaysian
plantations certiﬁ ed, United Plantations is setting a
long time-frame for achieving certiﬁ cation in Indo-
nesia. In the meantime, it continues to develop its
new plantations in Indonesia and clear the forests.
The uncritical acceptance of United Plantations
time-bound plan also sets a dangerous precedent
for other companies starting certiﬁ cation. So far,
other company groups (e.g. NBPOL, Sime Darby,
KLK) have committed to achieving full certiﬁ cation
of their company groups within one to three years.

The RSPO requirements for partial certiﬁ cation
require that a mutually agreed resolution process
is in place when signiﬁ cant land disputes exist.

Between June and August 2008, four community
members were jailed allegedly as a result of their
opposition to land clearing activities by United
Plantations subsidiary PT SSS1 in Runtu village. As
of October 2008, the Runtu four are still imprisoned
in Palangkalanbun. Two villagers were charged
with assault of a worker and village leader after an
incident on the day that company workers brought
in heavy machinery to clear the land claimed by
these villagers. The other two were charged with
producing false land ownership documents.
Regardless of the validity of these charges, the
imprisonment of four villagers indisputably
demonstrates that signiﬁ cant land conﬂ icts exist in
the PT SSS1 oil palm concession owned by United
Plantations.

One of the arrested community members was
Mr. Suryansyah. Arrested on June 17, 2008, he was
still in jail at the time of writing this report. The
case of Mr. Suryansyah and his son Hendra, who
was detained after his father’s arrest, was made
public by Indonesian NGOs on 25 June 2008.29
Mr. Suryansyah’s land was converted into an oil
palm plantation while he was imprisoned and he
had no means to further defend his case or his
land (see picture A). Both the certiﬁ er and the
RSPO Review Panel failed to investigate the conﬂ ict
and instead awarded United Plantations with the
ﬁ rst certiﬁ cate for sustainable palm oil.

Check 3:
Replacement of primary or High
Conservation Value forest since
November 2005

RSPO rules for partial certiﬁ cation requires that
companies provide evidence that from November
2005 onward, new developments did or do not
involve the replacement of primary forest or any
area containing High Conservation Values.30
However, if areas were cleared between November
2005 and November 2007 and the High
Conservation Value status of these areas was un-
known or disputed, these areas are to be excluded
from the RSPO program until a compensation
program has been put in place. Meanwhile, all land
clearing in that period must be proven to be legal.31
As of November 2007, all new developments have
to have High Conservation Value assessments.

High Conservation Value
assessments
In the January 2008 announcement of the main
assessment  United Plantations stated that in
its Indonesian estates, there is nil replacement
of primary forest or any area containing High
Conservation Value’s since November 2005.32

The same document states that a High Conserva-
tion Value (HCV) assessment was obtained for one
estate and that two other HCV assessments were
in progress. However, all these were in PT SSS2,
a plantation that at that point had not even been
acquired by United Plantations.

For the estates of PT SSS1 that were at the time
owned by United Plantations no information was
provided, strongly suggesting that there are no HCV
assessments for these United Plantations estates at
all. This is remarkable because United Plantations
should have had completed HCV assessments for
all of its estates by November 2007. Furthermore,

Picture B:  Forest clearance in PT SSS1 Runtu estate in October

2008. In January the company claimed no develop-

ment would take place, so no HCVF assessment was

conducted.

the Greenpeace investigation team observed that
areas with potential HCVs had been and were still
being cleared by PT SSS1. In fact, investigators on
the ground found recent clearing of forests in PT
SSS1 areas, where UP had claimed “no development”
was to take place (see picture B & C).33

Some of the forests cleared and continuing to be
cleared by United Plantation in Kalimantan are on
peat34 or overlap with potential orangutan habitats
identiﬁ ed by the United Nations Environmental
Program (see map 1).35 The RSPO has adopted
HCV criteria that clearly include the protection of
endangered species (as is the case for orangutans)
and of forests that “provide basic services of nature
in critical situations (e.g. watershed protection...)”,
which would cover peatlands.36
However, as of the ﬁ rst quarter 2008, United
Plantations has completed a High Conservation
Value assessment for one unit only (PT SSS2) with
apparently no plans to start such an assessment
for PT SSS1, where forest clearance continues.

Deforestation
Forests as such are not protected by the RSPO
Principles & Criteria. However, in various
publications36 United Plantation creates the
impression that the newly acquired areas in
Indonesia are largely made up of grassland.

Picture D is taken from United Plantations’ annual
report from 2007, supporting their claim of mainly
developing grasslands, instead of clearing forests.

caption saying „Grassland makes up a vast area of the landbank

acquired.” The  picture is taken at Runtu shortly before land
preparation and ﬁ eld planting took place. ©United Plantations.

Investigations on the ground show a different
picture – United Plantation’s estates in Central
Kalimantan are not just empty grasslands,
with the forested areas not fully being spared from
deforestation. Due to the lack of proper forest cover
monitoring in Indonesia, the total area of forest
cleared by United Plantation is yet to be established.
However, evidence gathered by Greenpeace (as in
picture E) suggests that dense forest has recently
been cleared by the company.

forest cleared has been the same type of forest as that in the background. ©Greenpeace 2008.

Check 4:
Compliance with law

Permits
One of the RSPO’s key principles is that plantation
companies should be familiar with local law, and are
expected to respect and follow that law even when
local governments appear to divert from regular
practices often violating national laws themselves.
This principle applies also to non-certiﬁ ed
subsidiaries within groups who have estates that
are certiﬁ ed (“partial certiﬁ cation”).

It is important that local governments and plan-
tation companies follow the logical order of the
Indonesian licensing process. The basic process
(2002-2006) can be represented as follows:
Plantation Operation Permit (IUP) > Location
Permit/Izin Lokasi > Land Use Permit.

If a company accepts a Location Permit without ﬁ rst
having secured the Plantation Operation Permit,
any plantation development activities will be illegal.
If a company requests for, and is issued a Plantation
Operation Permit without having secured the legally
required prior approval of its Environmental Impact
Assessment (in Indonesian: AMDAL), the permit
should be revoked because all activities undertaken
on the ground will be illegal.

In the summary audit report, the certiﬁ er states
that licensing issues were fully investigated during
the audit. The audit team were satisﬁ ed that United
Plantations conform with the RSPO requirements
for partial certiﬁ cation. Thus PT SSS1 „is going ahead
as planned“, while planting in PT SSS2 had stopped
in February 2008 pending approval of outstanding
permits.38

Greenpeace disputes the certiﬁ er’s conclusion that
legal requirements and (thus) the RSPO require-
ments were met by United Plantations.

PT SSS1, for example, irregularly obtained several
Location Permits prior to having secured Plantation
Operation Permits. Companies are usually quick to
blame the local government for such “irregularities”.
But in the case of PT SSS1, the company proactively
approached the District Plantation Service with
requests for Plantation Operation Permits, without
presenting the legally required approval of Environ-
mental Impact Assessments from the AMDAL
Commission. For example, PT SSS1 applied for
Plantation Operation Permits for its Sungai Rangit
estates in October 2006, merely noting that its
AMDAL was “forthcoming”. The company was
granted the permit for the estates in December 2006,
but it was not until almost a year later (1 December
2007) that the AMDAL for the estates was approved.
UP’s own planting records40 suggest that some

2,000 ha were planted in 2007. In actual fact, sign-
boards on the ground indicate that well before the
issuance of even the Plantation Operation Permit,
PT SSS1 was already actively planting oil palms in
this estate (since at least February 2006).

To develop land without an approved AMDAL can
have severe adverse impacts on the environment
and local communities and requires the District
Head to withdraw the Plantation Operation Permit.
RSPO requires that there shall be no evidence of
non-compliance with law in any of the non-certiﬁ ed
holdings. This applies not only at the moment
of assessment, but applies retrospectively from
November 2005 onward.42

Another legally required document for companies
planning to log or clear a forested area in any
forestland and who applies for a Plantation
Operation Permit, is the Timber Removal Permit
(IPK). The IPK permit ensures that taxes are paid
over wood harvesting. PT SSS1’s land clearing
contractor in Runtu village was identiﬁ ed as
“CV Prima Karya”. A former senior member of
the Kotawaringin Barat Forest Service alleges that
neither PT SSS1, nor CV Prima Karya had secured
IPKs for land clearing for forested areas in Runtu
village as of October 2008. Yet, trees are being cut
in these areas.

Peatlands
Indonesian law stipulates that development or
degradation of peatlands deeper than 2 m is not
allowed.43
While it is true, that much of United Plantation’s
estates in Kalimantan are on mineral soils, in
our ﬁ eld investigations it was found that United
Plantations’ subsidiary PT SSS1 had been clearing
peatlands, including deep peat (at least 3m thick)
in Runtu village (see picture F).

of 3 meters in PT SSS1, near Runtu village. Villagers

reported that land clearing commenced in early 2008.

Buffer zones
Indonesian law states that areas surrounding lakes
are conservation areas and should not be opened
up for plantation development 50-100 m land
inward.44
During ﬁ eld investigations, the buffer zone of the
Runtu tidal lake complex of Lake Soba, Suwakai,
Kelapa Timbul and Pataloran, located within the
concession area of PT SSS1, was found partially
cleared. It is not known when this land clearing
took place, but the sites showed tracks of recent
movement of heavy equipment (see picture G).

This is in stark contrast with United Plantation’s
conservation initiatives in Malaysia where the
certiﬁ ers’ assessment team was impressed with
United Plantations’ “Lagoon Nature Reserve”,
where United Plantations incorporated a lagoon in
its estates, planting rare Malaysian tree species.45

debris in the lake, presumably when the water level in this tidal lake was low. ©Greenpeace 2008.

Maximum concession area
Indonesian regulations specify that a single
plantation company cannot control a plantation
area in excess of 20,000 ha in each district.46
On April 27, 2007, United Plantations entered into
an agreement with the former owners of PT SSS1
and PT SSS2 to purchase both companies and to
merge PT SSS2 into PT SSS1. This would have led to
a company owning 40,000 ha in one district. When
this inconsistency with national law was duly noted
by UP it announced: “due to Indonesian authorities’
administrative differences restricting a single company
holding areas in excess of 20,000 hectares, the

Company has decided not to pursue the merger.
Thus, PT SSS1 and PT SSS2 will remain as separate
entities.”47  The company then goes on describing
its solution to circumvent this legal problem:
“The Company is in the process of acquiring the shares
of PT SSS2 directly vide another Malaysian subsidiary
company, and obtaining the approvals of the relevant
Indonesian and Malaysian authorities.”48
While this procedure may not be illegal, it certainly
violates the spirit of the Indonesian law, which is
attempting to restrict regional dominance of major
industry players.

Summary:  United Plantation as a testcase

for RSPO

This Greenpeace investigation demonstrates that deforestation, deep peat conversion, land disputes and
illegal practices continue to occur in the plantation estates owned by a company that is RSPO certiﬁ ed for
part of its operations.

This case clearly shows the failure of the company, the RSPO and the certiﬁ cation process. How could it be
that United Plantations received their certiﬁ cation for plantations in Malaysia, while destructive practices in
Indonesia continued as business-as-usual? This shows a fundamental ﬂ aw within the RSPO as it fails to
monitor the obligations of their members to comply with even the minimum criteria at a company level.
The certiﬁ ers have ignored several issues including land conﬂ icts, operations in breach of Indonesian law,
development and continued clearance of forests and peatlands without High Conservation Value assessments,
even though some of this land clearing took place on peat more than 2 m deep and is therefore illegal.

Greenpeace calls for the suspension
of the United Plantations RSPO
certiﬁ cate on the following grounds:
•   For not having “challenging and realistic”
frame for the certiﬁ cation of its estates in
Central Kalimantan

•  For having triggered signiﬁ cant land conﬂ icts
without a mutually agreed resolution process
in place

•  For having cleared potential HCV areas,
seemingly without HCV assessments
•  For non compliance with Indonesian law,

namely,

  -  developing peatlands with more than 2 m

depth

  -  intrusion into the buffer zones around the

Runtu lake complex

  -  plantation development without an approved
Environmental Impact Assessment (AMDAL)
  -  instigating the issuance of irregular permits

by local authorities

•  efforts to try to circumvent Indonesian

regulations on maximum plantation areas to
be held by a single company

The RSPO must:
•  Take concrete action to stop deforestation and
peatland conversion for “sustainable” oil palm
expansion

•  Ensure that its members prevent land disputes,

and proactively resolve current conﬂ icts

•  Ensure good governance by insisting that its

members follow the legal procedures that exist for
plantation development

The standards of RSPO are both insufﬁ cient and
voluntary and in its current form the RSPO will not
solve the problems of deforestation in South-East
Asia. The case of United Plantations is a ﬁ rst

indication that the fears of Greenpeace that
companies use the RSPO as a greenwash while
expanding in the last forests of this region seems
to come true. Meanwhile, European governments
merely rely on RSPO to sort out the problems
while they boost the demand for palm oil by
setting mandatory targets on bio-fuels. However
while RSPO-members, even those certiﬁ ed,
continue to clear forests and peatlands it is clear
that there is no sustainable palm oil on the market.
Voluntary measures from industry will not stop
the rampant deforestation in South-East Asia and
urgent political action is required.

Greenpeace is calling for the Indonesian
government to implement a moratorium on
further deforestation and peatland clearance,
to not allocate any more concessions of
forested estate for conversion and to revoke
those concessions on forested estate that
have been allocated but not yet been cleared.

This call for a moratorium is supported by
major palm oil users, like Unilever and other
companies. We call for the RSPO to support
this moratorium and pressure the Indonesian
government to take urgent action. The RSPO
standards must be tightened to ensure that
members stop deforestation and peatland
clearance in all their operations.

European governments must:
•  Support the call for a moratorium on further

deforestation and peatlands clearance

•  Allocate funds to protect forests and peatlands
•  Refrain from policies that stimulate the

expansion of the palm oil industry, like the
mandatory target for bio-fuels, and subsidies for
palm oil in electricity production.

42    Greenpeace interpretation of the unpublished

2008 (RSPO, 2008)

43    Decree no 376/1998 issued by the Ministry of
Forestry and Plantations, 8 April 1998, gives
criteria for choosing areas for oil palm
plantations: ‘plantation developments on peat
soils deeper than two metres are not allowed

44    Presidential Decree no 32/1990, article 3 and
5 on Conservation Areas;  The reference point
being the point of the highest tide.

23    Control Union (2008a); this attachment is

45    Control Union (2008b)

supposed to be ﬁ lled in by the company that
intends to be certiﬁ ed. In this case it remains
unclear if this was indeed done by United
Plantation or the certiﬁ er Control Union.
The document was  prepared to be signed by
UP’s director Carl Bek-Nielsen on January 7,
2008, but his actual signature is missing.
