BLACK HOLES IN 
DEEP OCEAN SPACE:
CLOSING THE LEGAL VOIDS IN HIGH SEAS 
BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION
1. Ocean space: the final frontier - filling the void in deep ocean regulation
The current piecemeal approach and voluntary measures for the conservation of high seas biodiversity are simply insufficient to  ensure that
states take action to effectively protect the unknown treasures of the open ocean. In addition to the short-term measures identi fied below
(see Box 1), it is necessary to revise the current oceans governance system in order to achieve the conservation objectives of t he United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in the medium to long-term.
Building on the existing provisions and set within the broad framework of UNCLOS, any revised regime should principally:
*provide a clear mandate and legal duty to protect biodiversity on the high seas, based on ecosystem-based management 
and the precautionary principle;
*promote co-ordination and harmonisation between relevant international and regional instruments;
*clarify the rules governing access to and the sharing of benefits d erived from high seas genetic resources;
*provide adequate implementation tools, including a mandate to establish and manage marine reserves in areas beyond 
the limits of national jurisdiction;
*establish an effective centralised monitoring, control and surveillance mechanism for human activities 
on the high seas.“The law of the sea
seemed to unite
humanism, the attempt
to build a human law and
order, and romanticism,
the love of nature and 
of the oceans as part 
of nature. It offered 
a starting point for 
a new philosophy – an
“ecological worldview” 
– and a new economic
theory – sustainable
development, the
economics of the
common heritage.”
Elizabeth Mann Borgese,
in Freedom for the Seas in
the 21st Century (1993)
Modelled on the 1995
UNFSA, a new implementing
agreement under the auspices
of UNCLOS should be drawn
up to address these five
principle objectives through a
list of detailed provisions.
The new implementing
agreement would elaborate on
and provide for the
implementation of existing
provisions of UNCLOS Part XII
on the Protection and
Preservation of the Marine
Environment and Parts VII and
XI concerning the high seas andthe sea-bed, subsoil and ocean
floor beyond areas of national
jurisdiction (the Area), obliging
states to take specific measures
to protect biodiversity.
The advantages of using
UNCLOS rather than the CBD
or other agreements as the legal
basis for such an agreement are:
*UNCLOS is regarded as
the framework agreement
that delimits ocean areas
and details state rights and
duties in the high seas and
the ‘Area’;*UNCLOS’s broad remit
already covers most or all
activities which impact on
marine biodiversity,
including, for example,
emerging activities such 
as bioprospecting, noise
pollution and the
introduction of alien
species;
*UNCLOS provides a
binding dispute settlement
mechanism.© NOAA/MBARI05Published by Greenpeace International OCTOBER 2005 www.greenpeace.org

of the Convention. It would further be consistent with Article
22(2) of the CBD, which already obliges contracting parties to
implement the Convention 
“with respect to the marine environment consistently 
with the rights and obligations of States under the Law 
of the Sea.”
In addition to the more general objectives mentioned above,
the new implementing agreement must include a list of detailed
provisions as summarised below (see Box 2).

BOX 2 :Provisions of a new implementing agreement 
under UNCLOS 
A new UNCLOS implementing agreement on the conservation of
marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction should:
*recognise the high seas as an area of scientific value for
peaceful purposes, as well as a natural reserve that is part
of the common heritage of humankind;
*lay down the general principles of the precautionary and
ecosystem approach as the core components for the
conservation of marine biodiversity on the high seas;
*consolidate existing provisions, such as those included in the
UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the IMO framework etc, and
bring them into the context of biodiversity protection;
*prohibit highly destructive practices in areas beyond the
limits of national jurisdiction;
*give a clear mandate for the identification, selection,
establishment and management of high seas marine reserves;
*identify ecological and practical criteria and guidelines for
the establishment of high seas marine reserves;
*oblige the establishment of a management plan for 
marine reserves;
*oblige states to establish regional environmental
management organisations in high seas areas to regulate
human activities in specific regions of interest;
*require prior environmental impact assessment (EIA) and
approval for all activities planned to occur on the high seas;
*require that all high seas fisheries are managed in a
responsible and sustainable manner , and based on the
ecosystem approach and precautionary principle as
stipulated in the UNFSA and FAO Code of Conduct for
Responsible Fisheries;
*build on existing inventories to develop a list of priority
areas for biodiversity protection;
*establish a centralised monitoring, control and surveillance
agency with a register and database of all high seas 
fishing vessels;
*encourage information and knowledge sharing on high seas
biodiversity through the creation of a central list of high
seas species available to all;
*establish a secretariat and a scientific committee in order 
to carry out the terms of the agreement;
*support shared and collaborative scientific research for the
identification of areas and species of special concern;
*secure long-term funding for the management and
enforcement of marine reserves as well as sustainable
oceans management across the high seas;
*set a timetable for review of implementation of the agreement.BOX 1 :Short-term conservation measures
Without immediate action to protect marine biodiversity from the
most acute pressures, many of the deep secrets of our oceans will
be lost before we can secure their long-term protection. Short-term
measures that the international community must take now are:
*A UN General Assembly moratorium on high seas bottom
trawling is the only feasible short-term measure that can
ensure that states meet their obligations under the CBD,
UNCLOS, the WSSD Programme of Implementation 
and the UNFSA to effectively conserve the benthic 
marine environment;
*The establishment of a centralised monitoring, control and
surveillance authority to regulate the activities of high seas
fishing vessels;
*The definition of the term ‘genuine link’ for fishing vessels;
*A prohibition on all at-sea transhipments of fish 
and fish products.

BLACK HOLES IN DEEP OCEAN SPACE |  32. There are more maps of the moon than the deep ocean:
Charting the way towards comprehensive regulation for the
conservation of high seas biodiversity
The international waters of the high seas are our common
heritage. Most of the resources of this global commons are non-
renewable.The high seas must therefore be considered off limits to
extractive and disposal activities unless and until it can be shown
that these activities do not cause harm to the surrounding
environment.The protection of marine biodiversity on the high seas
requires a collective approach and a clear political commitment
from all states.
A new UNCLOS implementing agreement needs to fill the gaping
void in the current regime for the protection of marine biodiversity
by establishing a strong institutional framework for high seas
biodiversity protection. Building on existing structures and, where
necessary, reforming or creating new bodies, co-ordination, co-
operation and compliance with existing provisions must be
improved. It must also be flexible to allow for potential future
activities to be brought into the regulatory framework. Particularly
important is the consideration of implementing tools and
enforcement mechanisms.
The implementing agreement should further provide a clear
mandate for the establishment and protection of high seas marine
reserves as well as the tools necessary to enforce reserves and
other high seas conservation measures.To this end it must put in
place an effective monitoring, surveillance and control system for
all high seas fishing vessels, including a mandate to protect the
integrity of high seas marine reserves.
Unless the international community agrees to act on its
commitments to protect the marine environment, future
generations will be denied the chance to experience or enjoy the
benefits of this last remaining global commons. Short-term interim
measures must be taken to protect the deep-sea from its current
most serious threats – particularly destructive practices such as
high seas bottom trawling. But if nation-states are serious about
protecting the marine biodiversity of the high seas, then
negotiations must start now for a new UNCLOS implementing
agreement that can ensure that the duties to protect and conserve
high seas biodiversity are spelled out for all states, and that the
pressures being faced by this final frontier that is the common
heritage of all humankind, can be sustainably and equitably
managed for now and for the future.3. Freedom for the Seas in the 21st Century
When Hugo Grotius expressed the notion of Freedom of the Seas –
mare liberum – in 1609, fishing was done with wooden sailboats
and it was presumed that the oceans were limitless and
inexhaustible. Most of the world’s oceans were too far , too deep,
too rough, too cold or too dangerous to fish. In practice, this
meant that fishing was only possible in the 10-12% of the world's
oceans that are now viewed as coastal waters. In other words,
almost 90% of the oceans were no-fishing zones: de facto marine
reserves.Today, with the increase in technological and industrial
efficiency, fishing vessels are able to fish from the Arctic to the
Antarctic and to depths of 2.5 km. With the ever increasing
evidence of collapsing fish stocks, it is clear that the oceans’
resources are not infinite and as a result of human activities, are
diminishing at an alarming rate.The marine safe-havens of Grotius’
day no longer exist, and the oceans are no longer boundless.
The evidence is irrefutable: current high seas oceans management
is creating the biggest unseen and potentially irreversible
environmental disaster of our time. Marine biodiversity is being
unsustainably plundered because of legal gaps and the lack of
political will to change the status quo.To stop the destruction of
high seas biodiversity, the current presumptions in favour of
freedom of the high seas and the freedom to fish must be reversed.
The challenges facing our oceans in the 21st Century require that
the primacy of the concept of “Freedom for the Seas” ( Libertas
Mari) be restored.The international community must act now on
its commitments to protect the marine environment, so that future
generations have the freedom to enjoy the benefits of this last
remaining global commons sustainably and equitably. In order to
ensure that our oceans are not taken further down the destructive
path of overexploitation, immediate action must be taken to
transform outdated policies and do away with false presumptions.
Almost four decades ago, Arvid Pardo the UN Ambassador for
Malta, developed the concept of the common heritage of humankind
in relation to ocean resources. In 1967, Pardo limited his
explanation of this concept to the seabed, ocean floor and subsoil
thereof, which was later encapsulated in Article 136 of the Law of
the Sea Convention and led to the creation of the International
Seabed Authority. However , Pardo expanded on the notion of the
common heritage of humankind in his 1971 ‘Draft Oceans Space
Treaty’ in which he stated that all ocean space beyond national
jurisdiction was the common heritage of humankind. He recognised
that the economic potential of the deep-sea extended beyond
mineral extraction to the exploitation of marine l iving resources, and
that the development of new technologies would enable this to occur
in the near future. Pardo argued that all ocean space beyond areas
of national jurisdiction – through the water column to the seabed –
must be managed in such a way as to ensure that its resources are
viewed as the common heritage of humankind and its benefits
sustainably and equitably shared.

The time has come for decision-makers to revisit Pardo’s
proposal by closing the gaps in oceans governance to ensure
that the wealth of biodiversity residing in the international
waters of the high seas is secured for the benefit of future
generations and the planet as a whole.
4. The Deep Blue: exploring ocean space 
From its sparkling surface to the darkest crevasses of the depths
below, the sea holds its secrets closely. But, we are gradually
learning that the seabed of the open ocean as well as the cold dark
waters of the deep-sea, teem with life. Much of this diversity is
concentrated on and around large undersea mountains,
hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and other underwater features that
act as oases in the otherwise monotonous flats of the abyss.The
biodiversity found on many of these deep-sea features is as rich -
and some believe richer - than that found in the ancient rainforests
of the terrestrial world.
Many of the species of the deep-sea remain unknown and probably
endemic to specific locations – meaning they are not found
anywhere else on the planet. Scientists estimate that they have
properly surveyed less than one tenth of 1% of these deep-sea
habitats.They believe that species numbers ‘vary between 500,000
and 10 million.’1These same scientists report that in recent years,
around 2000 new marine species have been discovered annually -
an average of 5 per day2, with species diversity thought to be as
high as 1,000 per square metre in the Indo-Pacific Ocean.3
The deep-sea typically supports marine life that is particularly
sensitive to disturbance. Many of the species are delicate and slow
growing – such as cold water corals that can live for thousands of
years. Fish such as orange roughy outlive humans, reaching an
age of over 120 years, and do not mature or reproduce until they
are 20-30 years old. Crabs, basket stars, prawns and octopi live
within the habitats provided by delicate sponge gardens and coral
forests, forming a complex and fragile web of marine life.
Unfortunately, the abundance of life associated with these
habitats has attracted human attention mostly for exploitative
rather than exploratory reasons.
Industrial fishing vessels such as deep-sea bottom trawlers are
laying waste to these oases of the deep, extracting an estimated
170,000 – 215,000 metric tonnes of fish each year at a value of
around $300-$400 million per annum.4In just one sweep, a single
bottom trawl can leave an area of seamount almost devoid of life.
Bottom trawling is one of the most destructive fishing practices
ever developed and is presently the largest immediate threat to
deep-sea biodiversity on the high seas.Bottom trawling is not the only activity that impacts on the deep
blue. Scientists and corporate entities are increasingly interested in
the genetic specialisations of deep-sea organisms l iving under
conditions of extreme pressure, temperature and toxicity.The study
and harnessing of these genetic resources for possible
pharmaceutical or industrial applications is known as
“bioprospecting”. Already several valuable products have been
created as a result of these discoveries, and there is growing
recognition of the potential of deep-sea genes to advance human
welfare. Emerging activities such as deep-sea bioprospecting, are
developing at the cutting edge of science and outside any
regulatory framework.The cumulative impacts of trial extraction
and the potential for industrial-scale harvesting of deep-sea
organisms poses a real threat to the protection of deep-sea
biodiversity and its sustainable and equitable use.5
Evidence is also emerging that indirect threats from climate
change, invasive species and ocean noise may also have significant
impacts on ocean biodiversity. A recent report by the Royal
Society, the UK's national academy of science, suggests that if
global emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities continue
to rise at current rates, the average pH of the oceans could fall by
0.5 units - equivalent to a rate of change one hundred times that
of past millennia.The magnitude and scale of this change is
enormous and biological effects are inevitable. Calcifying
organisms such as corals which rely on calcium carbonate to
generate supporting life structures, are thought to be most at risk.6
Other known consequences of climate change are increased storm
surges and wave activity, an increase in sea temperatures and
ultimately, a shift in ocean currents.
“For too long, the world acted as if the oceans
were somehow a realm apart – as areas owned by
no-one, free for all, with little need for care or
management. The Law of the Sea Convention and
other landmark legal instruments have brought
important progress over the past two decades in
protecting fisheries and marine ecosystems. But
this common heritage of all humankind continues
to face profound pressures.”
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, at the meeting of the
Seychelles and the United Kingdom “Reefs, Island
Communities and Protected Areas — 
Committing to the Future” (2004)

DEEP OCEAN SPACE:
CLOSING THE LEGAL VOIDS IN 
HIGH SEAS BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION
5. Existing mechanisms for governing the high seas 
The unsustainable plundering of marine biodiversity is largely due
to legal gaps (see Box 1) in the current oceans governance regime,
as well as the lack of political will by states to fundamentally
change the status quo in favour of an integrated and
comprehensive management regime that will ensure the future
health and vitality of our oceans. Current principles that favour
freedom of the high seas and the freedom to fish must be replaced
by ones that entrench the concept of freedom for the seas - with
the ecosystem approach and precautionary principle forming the
core of all oceans management decision-making.
UNCLOS and the CBD provide the international legal framework
governing the protection of the marine environment. However , there
is no overarching legally binding agreement that effectively and
comprehensively addresses the protection of biodiversity on the
high seas, and is able to effectively implement the relevant
provisions contained in these conventions. A brief summary of
some of the key elements of these conventions vis-a-vis biodiversity
conservation follows.
5.1. UNCLOS While UNCLOS offers states the right to use our
oceans as well as the duty to conserve them, it fails to provide explicit
tools for the implementation of environmental protection provisions.
One exception is the obligation for states to cooperate in dete rmining
the total allowable catch for l iving resources being exploited on the
high seas (Article 119). In addition, fisheries management measures
for straddling and highly migratory stocks are further elaborated in
the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA). However , to date this
agreement does not apply to discrete deep-sea stocks, and thus leaves
a huge gap in the international management regime for a number of
deep-sea fisheries.5.2. CBD In addition to responsible fisheries management, an
important tool to help comprehensively protect marine
biodiversity is the establishment of a global network of marine
reserves.The UN Millennium Project calls for 10% of the oceans
to be covered by marine reserves in the short- to medium-term,
with a long-term goal of 30%. In 2004, echoing pledges taken at
the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), the
CBD’s 7th Conference of the Parties (CoP 7) committed to the
establishment of a global network of marine protected areas by
2012 (Decision VII/28). According to Decision VII/5, such a
network should be composed of:
“comprehensive, effectively managed, and ecologically
representative national and regional systems of protected
areas that collectively … contribute to achieving the three
objectives of the Convention and the 2010 target to
significantly reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss”.
The CBD is the primary instrument providing direction to states
for the establishment of marine protected areas and marine
reserves in waters under their jurisdiction.The CBD further holds
states responsible for the regulation of activities and processes
within and beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, irrespective
of where their impact may be felt, provided they occur under the
control of a Contracting Party.7This obliges Parties to apply the
Convention to all its activities either in the EEZ or on the high
seas, and acknowledges the need for protective measures in areas
beyond national jurisdiction. It does not, however , oblige states to
take collective measures to protect the high seas.
BOX 4 :Greenpeace definition of Marine Reserves
Marine reserves are one type of Marine Protected Area.
In terms of protecting the marine environment, they offer 
the highest level of protection - much like national parks in 
the sea.They are closed to all extractive uses, such as fishing
and mining, as well as to industrial and disposal activities.
Greenpeace calls for a network of large-scale marine reserves
to cover around 40% of the ocean surface. Within these 
areas there may be core zones where no human activities 
are allowed, for instance areas that act as scientific reference
areas or areas where there are particularly sensitive 
habitats or species.BOX 3 :Gaps in governance of high seas biodiversity 
*No formal recognition of the need to protect biodiversity on
the high seas and no mechanism with a mandate to do so;
*No mandate for the protection of areas on the high seas for
conservation purposes;
*No conservation enforcement mechanism and competent
enforcement body;
*No framework for access to and benefit sharing of l iving
marine resources on the high seas;
*Insufficient geographic coverage and lack of competent
fisheries management;
*Emerging activities, such as bioprospecting, remain outside
the regulatory framework;
*Lack of regulation of ocean noise and its potential impacts
on marine life;
*No regulation of discrete deep-sea fish stocks.

5.3. Regional Fisheries Management Organisations Articles 5
and 6 of the UNFSA require the application of the ecosystem and
precautionary approach to fisheries through the mechanism of
Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs). Of the
30 RFMOs mandated under the UNFSA to regulate and protect
straddling or highly migratory stocks, only five are competent to
manage all or most of the l iving marine resources falling within
their regulatory areas.The mandate of the others is limited to
cover certain specific species, such as tunas. Almost all of the
existing RFMOs fail to explicitly provide for the application of the
ecosystem approach or precautionary principle in fisheries
management. Only the Commission for the Conservation of
Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the Southeast
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) are specifically
mandated in their constitutional agreements to implement the
ecosystem approach to fisheries management. SEAFO has yet to
adopt and implement any measures applying this approach to its
convention area. Even CCAMLR, with its proactive mandate and
conservation measures, struggles to deal with the scourge of
illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing by flag-of-
convenience vessels, non-parties, and in some cases its own
parties, who fail to abide by its rules.
In both its 2002 and 2004 review of the state of the world’s
fisheries, the FAO noted this lack of an explicit mandate in
RFMOs for ecosystem-based fisheries management.The review
suggests that extending the number of RFMOs with a mandate to
adopt an ecosystem approach, as well as forging closer links
between environmental and fisheries organisations, will facilitate
better and more effective implementation.8
Further analysis by Greenpeace has identified a list of
shortcomings in the constitutional commitment of RFMOs to the
ecosystem and precautionary approach (see Box 5). Fundamental
change and reform of RFMOs is urgently needed if they are to
adapt to the governance challenges of this century.These must go
hand in hand with innovative developments in high seas oceans
management if the oceans governance challenges of today and the
future are to be met.
Even if RFMO management was adequate to protect high seas
biodiversity, the limited geographical coverage of RFMOs with the
competence to regulate deep-sea fisheries and their impacts on the
benthic environment, leaves approximately three-quarters of the
high seas completely unregulated.The UN Secretary-General
recently reported the gaps in coverage as being the southeast
Pacific Ocean for all fish stocks, and the southwest Atlantic, south-
east Pacific, west-central Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Caribbean
for straddling fish stocks and discrete high seas fish stocks.9In addition to the provisions of UNCLOS, the UNFSA and related
instruments, and the CBD, there are also a number of voluntary,
species-specific or sectoral agreements that collectively set out a
piecemeal governance structure for managing human activities on
the high seas.
The FAO’s 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and
2001 International Plan of Action (IPOA) to prevent, deter and
eliminate IUU fishing attempt to address some of these issues.
Although these agreements apply to all fishing activities, including
those fisheries not covered by the UNFSA (i.e. discrete stocks),
both the Code of Conduct and IPOA-IUU are voluntary agreements
and therefore lack the weight and the ‘teeth’ (i.e. ability to impose
sanctions for violations) of legally binding agreements.Their
ineffectiveness is compounded by the lack of the necessary political
commitment by states to achieve implementation.
The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) sets up a framework
of protection for certain species groups such as cetaceans, seals,
sea turtles and sea birds.The International Whaling Commission
(IWC) has continued to uphold a politically fragile moratorium on
commercial whaling since 1982, despite a year-on-year struggle to
maintain support for such a measure. However , more positively,
the IWC has succeeded in designating two whale sanctuaries in
high seas areas.10
As for the significant proportion of high seas biodiversity that is
sedentary, i.e. l iving on and/or attached to the sea floor , the
regulatory system is considerably weaker . Whereas coastal states
have the right and obligation to control the exploitation of such
‘living resources’ on their continental shelf and margin, or up to a
distance of 200 nautical miles from the coast (whichever isBOX 5 :Institutional weaknesses of RFMOs
*Decision-making is often weak and driven by a need to reach
consensus rather than based on ecological or scientific
grounds.The small number of states party to RFMOs and
the possibility of opting out of decisions by lodging a
reservation further weakens decision making;
*Many RFMOs are not required by their constitutions to
apply the precautionary approach or ecosystem approach to
fisheries, so scientific advice and uncertainties are not
adequately translated into the decision-making process;
*Member States fail to take action against non-Members and
Members acting in breach of agreed measures. Member
States may continue to issue licenses to vessels that have
breached RFMO provisions;
*Constitutional and institutional incapacity means many
RFMOs have a single species focus and do not account for
impacts on associated and dependent species;
*Lack of international direction and inadequate co-ordination
among RFMOs weakens their ability to tackle IUU fishing.

furthest), the responsibility for the conservation and management
of sedentary species in areas beyond the continental shelf, and thus
in most areas of the high seas, remains unclear under UNCLOS.
Their exploitation is thus unregulated.This leaves another huge
vacuum in the protection of such species, many of which are
currently of most interest to bioprospectors. UNCLOS further
contains no explicit provisions regulating the use or equitable
benefit sharing of genetic resources derived from marine organisms
living in either the water column or seabed of the high seas.
5.4. Shipping The International Maritime Organisation (IMO),
established in 1958 under the UN umbrella, regulates all
activities related to shipping and, as part of its mandate,
introduces environmental protection measures to address
pollution and other adverse effects from shipping. Although its
mandate does not explicitly cover biodiversity protection, the IMO
has established a number of relevant instruments including the
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
Ships (as modified by the MARPOL Protocol 73/78), the
International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling
Systems on Ships (not yet in force) and the International
Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast
Water and Sediments (not yet in force).
The IMO regime provides the possibility to define certain sea
areas as “special areas” and Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas
(PSSA), which are provided with a higher level of protection than
other areas of the sea.11The control of maritime activities in
PSSAs is designed to give permanent protection and can include
routing measures, strict application of MARPOL discharge and
equipment requirements for ships, such as oil tankers; and
installation of Vessel Traffic Services (VTS). Far too often,
however , provisions to control the impacts of the shipping sector
are still initiated reactively and in the face of disasters, or
designed to protect near shore waters of greatest interest to
coastal states.5.5. Black Holes in ocean space: legal voids hindering
effective high seas biodiversity governance In summary, the
existing regulatory system clearly does not cover biodiversity
protection on the high seas explicitly and comprehensively (see
Box 3). More worrying, is that even in areas where commitments
exist, there is little sanction against non-compliance. Partly to
blame for this lack of compliance is the limited membership of
states to international agreements, as well as a lack of political
will amongst the signatories to such agreements to secure the
long-term well-being of ocean life over short-term self-interest.
Further shortcomings include:
*insufficient co-ordination between and among the different
relevant instruments;
*the lack of clear rules governing access to and the sharing of
benefits d erived from high s eas genetic resources;
*a lack of adequate implementation tools such as a mandate to
establish marine reserves (no-take zones) in areas beyond the
limits of national jurisdiction; and
*inadequate monitoring, control and surveillance of extractive
and potentially polluting activities, particularly fishing, on the
high seas.
6. Conclusion 
The United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS)
provides the fundamental framework – the constitution – for
global oceans governance.To date, the Agreements in Part XI of
UNCLOS regarding seabed mining and the United Nations Fish
Stocks Agreement have implemented a number of the key
principles contained within UNCLOS. Greenpeace believes that the
time is ripe for a third UNCLOS implementing agreement – a
comprehensive, legally binding agreement which will implement the
UNCLOS provisions relating to the duties of states to cooperate in
the protection of the marine environment of the high seas. In
addition to harmonising institutional mandates and improving
coordination, this implementing agreement would facilitate the
establishment of a global network of high seas marine reserves. It
would further establish an “Interpol for the oceans” – a
centralised monitoring, control and enforcement agency.These
components are essential to ensure that the l iving resources of the
high seas global commons are sustainably and equitably managed
for now and for the future.1 |
