Illegal forest felling activities in Russia

FOREWORD

At the turn of the millennia humankind faced a problem of growing scale of illegal forest felling.
The present material refers to violations of forestry and environmental protection legislation, as well as
respective international conventions. In some countries the volumes of illegally cut wood have become
comparable to the scale of legal forest felling operations. For example, in Indonesia in late 90's official
volumes of logged wood were 25 - 28 million m3 and volumes of illegally logged wood - somewhere
between 17 and 30 million m3 (Natural Resources Management Program, Jakarta). In other countries
the authorities are getting involved in organisation of such illegal wood logging.

Recent research carried out in the framework of the 'Global Forest Watch' project in Cameroon,
showed  that  illegal  concessions  were  granted  by  authorities  of  the  highest  levels.  Some  researchers
dealing with the forestry complex in Brazil, believe that up to 80% of timber in the Amazon is logged
illegally. Illegal cuttings frequently take place not only in tropical forests, but in boreal forests as well.
For example, due to the lack of the Canadian Forestry Service controlling forests in the country, cases
of over-logging for instance, in the British Columbia, have gone far enough from being rare. There are
cases  when  illegal  forest  felling  operations  were  found  in  protected  natural  territories  in  Poland  and
Belarus.

Unfortunately, in Russia illegal wood logging has become a usual thing, and in some regions the
share of illegal timber in the total turnover of logged wood is getting more and more significant. The
purpose of the present survey is to sum up the data on illegal forest felling operations violating forestry
legislation.  Other  types  of  legislation  have  been  touched  upon,  too,  but  very  slightly.  However,  even
this  rough  analysis  shows  that  at  least  20%  of  timber  in  Russia  is  getting  logged  either  illegally  or
severely violating the existing legislation.

What  is  the  result  of  illegal  wood  logging?  Besides  all  the  damage  to  the  environment,  illegal
logging results in losses for the budget and corruption. It also blackens the image of the Russian forest
industry,  because  today  none  of  the  companies  buying  Russian  timber  can  be  100%  sure  that  all  the
wood they buy has been logged in conformity with the law.

Unlike many countries of the world, Russia has quite sophisticated forestry legislation and, what
is  even  more  important,  a  specific  method  for  implementing  this  legislation.  From  certain  points  of
view,  Russia's  forestry  legislation  is  redundant  and  regulates  even  those  forestry  aspects  that  in  many
other countries are left at the disposal of local forestry workers (foresters and managers). Sophistication
and redundancy of the legislation determine variety and the severity and extent of forestry violations or,
in other words, forms and methods of illegal felling activities.

Speaking about illegal cuttings in Russia, we use a definition of this notion given in Resolution
#14  of  the  Russian  Federation  Supreme  Court  of  December  5,  1998.  As  stated  to  wit:  'Illegal  forest

1

felling operation (cutting) is cutting of trees, bushes and lianas without a felling ticket, order of cutting
with  a  felling  ticket,  order  issued  with  abuse  of  the  existing  cutting-practice  rules,  as  well  as  cutting
carried out at the wrong site or beyond a site's borders, exceeding the set quantities, cutting of wrong
species or of trees, bushes and lianas that are not subject to cutting…'. We should point out here that
this  definition  is  related  to  the  procedure  of  application  of  Article  260  of  the  Russian  Federation
Criminal Code by court. A deed becomes subject to punishment when the damages imposed exceed a
particular  amount  (20  or  200  floor  wages).  However,  the  Rules  of  On-Stump  Wood  Allocation  in
Russian  forests  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Wood  Allocation  Rules  or  WAR,  endorsed  by  Russian
Federation Governmental Resolution #551 of June 6, 1998) set up fines for many of the violations. If
paid, these fines save a trespasser from criminal prosecution, despite the fact that the imposed damage
is large enough to become subject to the Criminal Code. This is a large loophole to avoid punishment
for very serious violations. In such a situation, the volume and number of violations constantly grows,
especially in those cases when official penalties are less than the profit that one can gain. Compounding
the problem is the fact that, in most cases, the agencies entitled to supervise different aspects of forestry
work  separately  from  one  another.  Moreover,  their  activities  (and  conclusions)  often  contradict  one
another. All this is further incentive to forest crimes and, in particular, to illegal cuttings. An integration
of all controlling bodies into one ministry will make the control of logging operations much weaker due
to the specific practice of violations outlined below.

Illegal cuttings can be divided into two large categories:

• cuttings carried on without permits or with forged permits,
• cuttings with official permits (felling tickets, orders for low-amount allocation) which, in and of

themselves, cannot guarantee that the felling is legal.

Each of these large groups consists of a wide range of variants. Clearly, the classification given
below is relative and each case is quite difficult to be defined by a particular scheme, especially if the
case, as it very often happens, is comprised of a number of violations simultaneously.

A.  CUTTINGS WITHOUT PERMITS (THEY ARE VERY OFTEN CALLED UNSANCTIONED)

1.  Cuttings carried out by local residents for personal needs.

This violation occurs for the following two reasons. First, small village residents in many regions
are too poor to buy even the smallest amount of timber and firewood they need. The second reason is
connected to the low efficiency of the forest service, meaning that it is easier and faster to go into the
forest and logs illegally than to get all of the official papers which are necessary. Our own experience
in  buying  of  logs  in  the  Moscow  and  Yaroslavl  Regions,  and  additionally  the  Regions  of  Tver,
Leningrad, Sakhalinsk and so on, reveal that to legally buy one log, or to get a permit to cut one tree, it
is necessary to spend 1 to 5working days. Besides that, the buyer has to get a car to take a forester to
the logging site and back, or a vehicle to fetch the log from the site for which the felling ticket has been
issued, if the log has already been cut by foresters. It is clear that in the majority of cases it is easiest to
go to the nearest forest and cut the necessary amount of timber. The foresters will hardly find out, and
the neighbours will not tell anyone, because they themselves are doing the same thing.

No doubt, there is a relatively large group of people unwilling to pay the State for the 'people's'
resources.  The  inefficiency  of  state  controlled  channels  fosters  the  development  of  such  attitudes.  In
such a situation, the forest protection principle that fixes a particular forest plot to one forestry service

2

officer will prove ineffective. A forester, being a man of principle, would become an outcast in his own
village  and  would  take  more  care  regarding  his  own  property  and  the  safety  of  his  family  than  about
protection  of  state  forests.  No  methods  of  social  protection  and/or  insurance  would  change  the
situation. It is often enough that the foresters themselves 'bless' such cuttings and not without profit to
themselves.

It  is  somewhat  difficult  to  assess  the  volumes  of  forest  cuttings  carried  out  by  the  local
population. Our very rough estimations say that the volumes are equal to some 8 to 10 million m3 of
timber annually, which is not registered officially.

2.  Cuttings carried out by residents or mobile teams for subsequent sale

This variant is most typical for logging of large-sized especially valuable wood. Accordingly, the
scale of such logging is largest in the southern part of the Khabarovsk Kray (region) and the Primorye
(ash-tree,  oak,  korean  pine,  nut  tree,  cork  tree)  and  in  the  Northern  Caucasus  (oak,  beech,  chestnut
tree). Only the officially registered volumes of such cuttings in Primorye exceed 10,000 m3 every year.

According to our information, only in the Roshchino leskhoz  in Primorye the annual volume of
unsanctioned cuttings of this type and of valuable tree species is 16 - 22 thousands cubic meters. The
deviation from the official figures can apparently be explained by the fact that the Roshchino leskhoz
did not register unsanctioned cuttings when they failed to impound illegally logged wood. There are no
reasons  to  say  that  other  leskhozes  act  in  another  manner.  That  is  why  the  actual  amount  of  illegally
logged wood is much larger than official figures.

Usually the teams (and in fact, illegal companies) operating via this strategy are very organised
and have good connections with the authorities of different levels. Many such teams are 'protected' by
criminals  or  bring  a  good  profit  to  criminal  groups.  For  example,  in  June  2000  after  a  more  detailed
research in illegal cuttings in the Krasnoarmeysk Region we encountered a large company dealing with
forest felling operations illegally. When the company workers were cutting trees, the logging site was
guarded by three patrol cars and armed security people were present at the logging site as well.

The results of the investigations conducted from February through June 2000 indicate that at least
in some areas, for example, the Krasnoarmeysk district of Primorye, the issue of illegal cuttings is no
longer a problem exclusively for the forestry department. Apparently, a greater part of the population,
companies and state agencies of the Krasnoarmeysk region, is involved in illegal logging and trade in
wood. Now we can speak not only about the illegal trade but also about a whole way of life, which has
the  illegal  sale  of  wood  as  its  essential  component.  People  in  the  regional  administration  say  that  the
part  of  the  population  making  a  decent  wage  apart  from  wood  logging,  is  the  first  to  get  involved  in
illegal  forest  felling  activities.  The  population  sees  illegal  cuttings  as  a  good  additional  source  of
money.  Probably,  in  these  activities  people  use  equipment  of  local  forestry  enterprises  and  wood
logging companies. The management of these enterprises is very often aware of what is going on, but
turns a blind eye because if their workers have a supplemental income, management can feel justified
for  giving  smaller  salaries  (and  this,  in  turn,  affects  the  taxes).  There  is  every  reason  to  believe  that
large  wood  logging  enterprises  also  accept  and/or  buy  illegally  logged  timber  from  the  population
(meaning, workers of these enterprises).

The location of illegal forest felling operations gives us reason to believe that the bulk of timber
goes  finally  to  the  China.  Control  over  timber  transporting  operations  in  the  district  has  become  a

3

political  and  financial  issue.  Over  the  last  two  years,  a  police  post  on  the  Novopokrovka  -
Dalnorechensk  road  has  been  organised  and  removed  several  times.  There  is  a  local  anecdote  stating
that a young police officer asked to be sent to this post because his family was in 'a difficult financial
situation'.  Local  residents  say  that  police  officers  working  at  the  post  in  winter,  bought  cars  (an
ordinary police officer could not afford a car because of his low salary). During the times the post was
missing, the transporting operations were especially active.

Along with mobile teams illegal cutting is a source of money for 'family teams'. Cuttings of this
kind are usually small-scale and loggers take 1-2 logs at a time. There were several times when we saw
such cuttings near the village Roshchino of the Krasnoarmeysk Region of Primorye in June 2000.

We  often  spoke  to  local  residents.  They  told  us  that  along  with  the  official  logging  companies
buying illegal timber, there are also private citizens who do the same thing. We even learn the name of
one such person who supposedly works for the Terneylesstroy company, that is for the Plastun - Olga
ports. Discovering his name was not too difficult, since all local people know the name and even this
man's  schedule  very  well,  as  do  local  administrations.  The  same  results  were  received  after  local
journalists  analysed  the  system  of  trade  in  illegally  logged  wood  (for  example,  see  the  'Posledniye
Izvestia' (Latest Events) newspaper dated July 7, 1999, http://www.novosti.vl.ru). It's worth noting that
none of the illegal wood dealers have ever been brought to justice.

Illegal forest felling operations of this sort very often occur near large timber consumers dealing
in  cash  and  careless  in  their  choice  of  suppliers.  Such  sites  include  forest  ports  in  Saint-Petersburg,
Vyborg,  Luga,etc.,  as  well  as  some  ports  in  the  Far  East,  some  wood-processing  and  pulp  and  paper
mills (for example in 1997-1998 the Svyatogorsky P&PM, now the situation has changed for the better;
in 1999 - the Syassky P&PM (see local newspaper 'Vestnik' dated May 6, 1999 #5)). There is a strong
reason to believe that such a scheme is very popular (more popular than outlined by official statistics).

Besides all of the above mentioned, there are unsanctioned cuttings for sale (or for illegal small
business - small-volume sawing and producing of traditional wooden houses and so on). Usually such
cuttings focus on widely spread tree species (spruce, pine, not very often, birch) that, as we think, don't
exceed  500,000m3  a  year.  Basically,  such  felling  operations  are  concentrated  in  certain  regions:  the
Republic  of  Karelia,  the  Leningrad,  Arkhangelsk  (southern  and  central  parts),  Novgorod,  Tver,
Yaroslavl, Ryazan, Vladimir, Moscow and Sakhalinsk Regions, possibly, the Irkutsk Region, southern
part of the Krasnoyarsk region and the Republic of Burayatia. Besides demand, there should be some
other key conditions for this type of cuttings. At the very least relative transport accessibility of forest
is  necessary,  including  those  forest  plots  where  all  types  of  felling  activities  are  prohibited,  and  local
residents  who  own  (or,  at  least,  have  a  possibility  to  use  illegally)  appropriate  equipment,  such  as
tractors, loaders or trucks equipped with  hydro-manipulators.

3.  Cuttings carried out by companies near officially developed sites or in the distant areas

that are seldom visited  by supervision agencies.

Some companies start logging wood illegally if they log a large wood volumes legally and have
several  wood-logging  teams  within  it.  The  key  condition  for  it  is  a  large  number  of  allotments
developed  simultaneously  and/or  an  area  difficult  to  access  for  supervising  organisations.  Such  a
situation is especially characteristic for military forestry enterprises that very often do not obey forestry
legislation. However, this might happen in the  forests belonging to agricultural enterprises and forests

4

of the Federal Forestry Service, as well. The fact is that if a team of loggers was not caught red-handed
where they were cutting wood illegally, it is very difficult to prove their connection to illegal cutting.
After three or more years (after the term of allocation materials and felling ticket storage in a local unit
of  the  Federal  Forestry  Service  (FFS)  is  over)  asserting  proof  becomes  completely  impossible.  Such
cuttings can be arranged after a direct agreement is reached with representatives of the local unit of the
FFS.

Illegal  cutting  of  this  type  can  be  easily  detected  if  we  compare  the  allocation  materials  and
felling tickets with space images of the area made a year before and by the time of the check. To detect
logging  sites  and  assess  their  size  we  can  use  images  with  a  resolution  of  100m  and  higher  (but  not
higher  than  30-35m).  The  problem  is  that  not  a  single  state  supervision  body  uses  space  images  for
these  purposes.  Moreover,  the  official  authorities,  for  example  the  Federal  Forestry  Service,  never
arrange any detailed research in this field and believe that such cuttings do not exist at all (and are not
even possible) or that their number is insignificant. Independent checks in this field are very difficult to
arrange, because all of the necessary papers (allocation material) are stored in leskhozes (local units of
the  Federal  Forestry  Service)  or  in  the  company  that  carries  on  illegal  cuttings.  These  materials  are
traditionally  considered  to  be  secret  and  become  even  more  closely  guarded  if  there  is  such  an
agreement between the leskhoz and the company.

According  to  the  data  we  have,  it  does  not  seem  possible  to  assess  volumes  of  such  cuttings.
However,  in  1998-2000  we  found  facts  proving  that  such  cuttings  did  exist  on  the  Sakhalin,  in  the
Khabarovsk and Krasnoyarsk regions and in the Republic of Buryatia. In all particular cases we could
speak of amounts from some hundred to some thousands of cubic meters of illegally cut timber.

2a-3a.  Fellings  on  the  places  of  officially  completed  selective  fellings,  including  officially

discovered and aborted unsanctioned cuttings

This  popular  method,  practised  by  locals,  companies  and  departments  of  the  Federal  Forest
Service  (now  the  Ministry  of  resources)  implies  that  an  unsanctioned  cutting  is  disguised  as  a
completed  and  accepted  felling,  or  as  an  unsanctioned  cutting  performed  by  another  individual  or
company, already discovered and aborted by the forest protection agents.

Clearly,  such  violations  are  exacerbated  by  the  practice  of  paying  the  forest  loggers  which
depends on amount was logged and the patrol system of forest protection under which one FFS ranger
solely supervises an allocated plot without being monitored by any superior or figure of authority.

In May 2000 in Prymorsky region local residents including workers of wood logging companies
considered  such  practices  as  usual  for  most  wood  logging  companies  and  some  leskhozes.  In  the
Krasnoarmeysk region we saw examples of such operations carried out most likely by the local leskhoz
(or its workers) and the military.

As  far  as  the  volume  of  illegally  logged  valuable  timber  is  concerned,  in  total  for  Russia  it
exceeds 600,000 m3. The volumes are not too high, but in cost-value terms they are equal to about 2-3
million m3 of less valuable tree species.

CASE:

5

In July 1998, in Pogranichnoye forestry of Smirnykhovski Leskhoz, a team from, in the words of
the team leader, OOO Smirnykh Les  sampled  large  spruce  trees  beyond  the  limits  of  its  own  logging
plot, in the area of an abandoned unsanctioned winter felling of another company. New logways were
built  in  the  unsanctioned  felling  area,  including  in  the  spawning-protection  stripe  of  the  Skvortsovka
River.  As of the moment of inspection, the total volume of fresh-cut wood exceeded 400 cubic meters
(over 220 trunks). The foreman at the logging site attempted to prove that the fresh summer logways
and  fresh  stumps  were  in  fact  the  results  of  another  team's  winter  operations.  It  was  apparent  that
illegal fellings in that area had been underway for a few weeks. All that time, the representatives of the
FFS had either not entered the logging site, or their inattention had been handsomely compensated.

********************************
It  is  worth  noting  that  in  many  cases  small  and  medium-scale  illegal  cuttings  are  very  easy  to
fight, because the places where the timber is cut and where it is sold are either well-known or are very
easy to discover.

For  example,  in  early  June  2000  a  Greenpeace  Russian  team  in  the  Krasnoarmeysk  Region  of
Promorye  with  no  problems  and  special  tricks  had  the  opportunity  to  videotape  five  unsanctioned
cuttings  on  the  stages  from  forest  felling  to  transportation  of  the  illegally  cut  wood.  The  foresters
(including those from the Roshchino leskhoz) say that they could easily stop illegal forest cuttings but
they  do  not  have  any  time  for  forest  protection  because  they  have  to  work  in  other  places  ('profit-
making  cuttings').  Moreover,  a  very  popular  practice  is  that  foresters  are  appointed  loggers,  chokers
and so on for the winter period.

Efficiency of other environmental protection agencies and law enforcement bodies cannot sustain
any criticism. Judging by what we saw, large illegal companies and teams are well aware of the time
and place where mobile police posts are set up. The same problems exist in other regions, too.

Another way to fight illegal cuttings is to introduce a few additional regular paper checks during
shipment, as well as confiscation of illegally shipped wood (and vehicles). Even if such paper checks
(checkpoints) don't prove 100% efficient, additional bribes that illegal loggers will have to pay at such
posts  will  make  a  significant  part  of  small-scale  illegal  wood-logging  business  unprofitable.  The
control  over  small-scale  forest  felling  operations  should  be  accompanied  by  a  stricter  control  over
operations of wood logging companies and exporters. In general, we think that the following should be
done to fight unsanctioned forest felling operations:

• change the system of forest protection when every forester is responsible for particular part of
the territory and start using small but very mobile and well equipped inspector teams operating only in
areas situated far from their permanent residences. Such teams should be organised first of all in those
areas where forest felling and wood logging operations are especially active.

• prohibition  of  any  economic  activities  by  forestry  bodies  (department  of  the  Federal  Forest

Service - the Ministry of natural resources) no matter how good their intentions might be;

• introduction  of  additional  (redundant)  checks  of  documents  for  the  timber  transported  on  the

roads leading to sale places;

• introduction  of  appropriate  amendments  to  the  Criminal  Code  and  Administrative  Infraction
Code to toughen punishment for forestry offences, as well as transportation and legalisation of illegally
logged wood;

6

• fully review of the procedure of assessment of actual volumes of wood logged at logging sites;
at  the  present  time  the  volume  assessment  is  based  on  the  Forestry  Committee  of  the  Soviet  Union
Instruction dates back to 1983 and is designed for a socialist 'unprofitable' economy. It is also necessary
to introduce new technologies and remote assessment methods;

• full review of the existing procedure of routine control over forest felling operations carried on

by wood loggers;

• enlargement of the powers of other agencies supervising forest management and operations of
forestry  bodies,  this  has  become  especially  important  after  the  environmental  protection  agencies  and
forestry service bodies were united into one ministry;

• to provide open and free-information on forest management to make public control possible; the
existing  procedure  of  public  access  to  information  about  forest  management  is  either  very  expensive
and people simply can't afford it or it lacks any information on how ordinary people can access such
important information sources as felling license, allocation materials etc.

• to introduce additional customs codes to the following round wood to be exported from Russia:
other spruce timber (except Norway spruce); other fir timber; Siberian and korean pine timber; walnuts,
alders; aspens. Such changes will allow to introduce more precise control on timber export as well as
more accurate comparison of logged and exported amounts.

The major part of the measures given above should prove very effective against most violations

in the field of wood logging.

The  fact  that  many  regions  suffered  from  unsanctioned  logging  do  not  introduce  effective
measures to control the situation or that such measures have been abandoned due to the pressure of the
loggers proves how deep the authorities are involved in the illegal timber trade and how corrupt they
actually are. Usually such regions (or the federal authorities under the pressure from such regions) take
specific actions not actually designed to stop these cuttings, only to imitate that the government makes
significant efforts to stop them.

For  example,  in  1999  licenses  for  valuable  tree  species  export  were  introduced  (in  the  Far  East
these were oak and ash-tree). After that it became impossible to ship and export such timber without an
appropriate  certificate  and  license.  However,  the  governmental  decision  implied  a  permissive  license
issue procedure, meaning that every person who applies for a license, should be given such license and
that this license should be given on the wood volumes he or she applied for. Formally the authorities
were afraid to create obstacles for the development of industry. On May 25, 1999 the Primorye Vice-
Governor, Vladimir Stegny, sent a letter to the Russian Federation Ministry of Economy.

The letter said, "From year to year volumes of valuable tree species export from the Primorye to
the  People's  Republic  of  China  and  Japan  significantly  exceed  the  legal  cutting  norms.  Automatic
export licensing without quantitative limits does not give any leverage to influence unfair exporters. In
Primorye, for the period of time from February 15 through May 20, 1999 export licenses were issued to
930.9 thousand m3 of valuable wood, when the regional norms for these species for the whole 1999 are
only 260,000m3".

In Primorye, about 260 thousand m3 of valuable tree species were permitted to be cut. However,
only Primorye companies exported officially (and declared) more than 500 thousand m3 (not including
those valid timber exported under customs code 440310900). The problem is that among all valuable

7

tree species in the Far East only oak has its own customs code in the Customs Code List for Foreign
Trade Operations1. Walnut, cork tree and ash tree together with lime, aspen and alder and other inferior
tree  species  were  sold  under  a  single  customs  code.  That's  why  it  is  impossible  to  say  precisely  how
much valuable timber was exported from Primorye and other Russian regions. It is clear, however, that
the  share  of  inferior  tree  species  in  timber  export  from  the  Russian  Far  East  was  very  small.  In  1999
there were several cases when people tried to illegally export valuable tree species (see, for example,
the 'Posledniye Izvestia' newspaper http://www.novosti.vl.ru and 'Sikhote-Alin' of December 14, 1999).
From our experience, we know that for each unsuccessful attempt to illegally sell valuable timber from
Russia abroad there are several successful ones. Additionally, we must take into account the fact that
the customs does not accurately inspect large consignments of timber actually shipped via sea transport
because  such  inspections  are  impossible  technically.  According  to  estimates  of  local  and  regional
administrations, in 1999 more than 600,000 m3 of valuable timber were exported only from Primorye,
which means that at least 300,000m3 were logged in the region illegally.

Large  volumes  of  the  export  licenses  that  exceed  the  permitted  cutting  volumes,  allow  timber
exporting companies to legalise illegally logged wood. In fact, when illegally logged wood comes to,
for example, the Plastun port or the Dalnerechensk base, it becomes legal being due to already issued
licenses.

4.  Fellings caused by the unauthorised construction of non-forestry facilities

At  present,  timber  is  often  felled  to  clear  areas  for  the  construction  of  industrial  or  commercial
facilities (buildings, quarries, etc.), based on the decisions of heads of local or regional administration
without  issuing  required  permits,  or  with  no  authorisation  whatsoever.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  the
culprits are not penalised, whereas the permits are issued post factum,  if  at  all.  Even  after  a  violation
has  been  officially  disclosed  and  a  protocol  has  been  drawn  up,  the  illegal  construction,  in  the  vast
majority of cases, is continued, because "money has already been invested" and the forest destroyed.

Such practices are common across the nation. Each individual case normally includes damages

to a small area. The total volume of such cuttings cannot be calculated.

B. 'LICENSED' BUT ILLEGAL FOREST FELLING OPERATIONS

The  existence  of  official  permits  for  cutting  operations  does  not  always  mean  that  a  particular
cutting  is  legal.  More  often  that  not,  cutting  permits  are  issued  in  defiance  of  current  legislation.  In
other instances, written permits are out of line with "on site" permits, or the cutting as it is performed

8

violates the conditions specified in the permit. In all the above cases, cuttings should also be considered
illegal, with the culprits subject to criminal penalties.

5.  Issuing  permits  for  felling  in  areas  where  felling  is  prohibited  or  not  envisioned  in

current legislation.

a) A classical example is cuttings in specially protected natural areas, or areas where cuttings are

explicitly forbidden by the nature protection regime.

Normally, such violations are caused by two basic reasons. First, leskhoz employees are ignorant
of current legislation and/or have no access to information on whether their leskhoz includes specially
protected  natural  areas  (primarily,  regional-level  ones).  Second,  state  forest  registration  and  forest
inventory  are  frequently  blind  to  bans  on  industrial  operations  in  specially  protected  natural  areas.
According to current legislation, forest inventory recommendations are mandatory. In the recent years,
the  number  of  such  violations  has  somewhat  declined  as  a  result  of  strict  measures  taken  by  state
environmental protection agencies.

Now  that  all  supervising  agencies  have  been  united  in  one  ministry,  the  number  of  such

violations should drastically increase.

Specially protected natural areas are often corrupted following the exhaustion of accessible wood
in adjacent areas. In such cases, protected areas are targeted by forest-logging companies. The attempts
to invade protected areas are sometimes aimed at the abolition of their status as such.

Besides,  on  many  occasions  cutting  permits  are  issued  under  pressure  from  local  authorities.  In
1999 and 2000, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Bashkortostan ordered the felling of several
dozens of square kilometres of woods in Bashkiriya National Park.

b) Cuttings not envisioned in forest inventory documents.
According  to  current  legislation,  forest  inventory  documents  (including  logging  plans)  form  the
basis  for  the  planning  of  all  economic  activities,  including  cuttings.  Deviations  from  forest  inventory
documents  (including  plans  for  cutting  not  envisioned  by  forest  inventory)  are  possible,  but  only  on
serious  grounds,  such  as  changes  in  the  forest  health  condition,  natural  disasters,  or  errors  in  forest
inventory.  In  all  the  above  cases,  the  procedure  for  amendments  is  unwieldy.  In  many  regions,
however, we encountered cuttings not approved by forest inventory performed with no excuses offered
at all. This is normally done at the orders of an individual forest user, especially if this user is also the
de facto unofficial authority in the area. We witnessed such cases in Leningrad, Arkhangelsk and Chita
Oblasts,  and  in  the  Republic  of  Buryatiya.  The  practice,  however,  must  be  spread  even  more  widely,
since most regions lack the mechanisms to detect such violations.

"Profit  cuttings"  not  envisioned  in  forest  inventory  are  popular,  to  various  degrees,  among
leskhozes  (departments  of  the  Federal  Forest  Service)  in  all  regions  where  such  cuttings  are  a
significant source of profit for FFS.

In this chapter we are not referring to situations in which the grounds for excessive cuttings are
legislative amendments made after the forest inventory. Such cuttings (provided the interpretations of
new legislation are correct) are legitimate. On several occasions, however, we could see economically
profitable  regulatory  amendments  introduced  enthusiastically,  while  others  were  postponed  until  the

9

next  forest  inventory  session.  In  1997  and  1998,  leskhozes  in  Leningrad  Oblast  were  vehemently
conducting  regeneration  (obnovlenye)    and  re-formation  (pereformyrovanye)  cuttings  provided  for  in
the  new  Instruction  on  Thinning  Cutting  and  not  in  the  forest  inventory.  At  the  same  time,  those
leskhozes  continued  accretion  cuttings  in  maturing  forests,  referring  to  forest  inventory  documents,
although that same new Instruction prohibited such cuttings in these forests.

6. Issuing logging permits with violations of the existing procedure for permit issuing, or without
the assessment of the real logging capacity without violations of current legislation.

a)  issuing  permits  without  real  assessment  of  the  volume  of  wood  allocated  on  stump,  or  with

gross errors in the calculation of volume.

Every  logging  operation  itself  should  be  preceded  by  forest  management  agencies  (leskhozes)
determining the size of the reserve in the plot and the value of wood allocated on stump. The procedure
for  determining  the  volume  of  wood  to  be  cut  is  quite  sophisticated,  which  results  in  numerous
violations  at  this  stage,  some  of  them  caused  by  low-quality  ("office-based")  calculation  methods,
others proceeding from deliberate errors made at the request of individual forest users. In this case, the
actual  sampling,  by  volume  and/or  tree-species  composition,  does  not  correspond  to  the  permit.  The
cutting becomes illegal. Upon receiving the plot into his operation, the forest user signs a protocol, thus
confirming  that  allocation  documents  reflect  the  real  situation  and  assuming  all  responsibility  for
further developments. The monopoly enjoyed by leskhozes does not allow forest users (companies) to
argue  with  leskhozes.  Our  data  show  that  gross  violations  in  wood  allocation  occur  in  all  regions  of
Russia, whereas in a number of regions (Leningrad, Novgorod, Arkhangelsk, Sakhalin, Chita, Irkutsk
and  Amur  Oblasts,  Khabarovsk  and  Krasnoyarsk  Krays,  Republic  of  Karelia)  it  has  become  a
predominant practice. The Rosleskhoz itself confirms the low quality of allocations.

b) issuing permits to companies unauthorised to be engaged in logging operations

In compliance with legislation, a company intending to conduct logging activities should undergo
a licensing procedure. In the absence of a pertinent federal regulation, each region has its own licensing
pattern.  A  number  of  regions  still  lack  any  endorsed  licensing  procedure.  However,  a  more  curious
precedent  is  set  by  both  licensed  and  unlicensed  forest  loggers  operating  within  the  boundaries  of  a
single region. Unlicensed operators are often considered "privileged", i. e. they have reliable 'friends' in
the regional administration. A recent example is the logging in a Sakhalin military forestry in the years
1999-2000. The  cutting  has  been  carried  out  by  an  unlicensed  company  owned  by  Sakhalin's  former
deputy governor. Such situations are very frequent in the Far East regions and in the European part of
Russia (for example, see the 'Priamurskiye Vesti' (Priamurye News) newspaper, April 1999).

c)  issuing  permits  to  companies  physically  incapable  of  cutting  and  transporting  wood  using

technologies authorized for the specific conditions.

This  type  of  violations  is  especially  characteristic  of  the  Far  East  where  skidding  and
transportation  of  wood  upon  the  creeks  or  springs  are  forbidden,  whereas  a  network  of  spawning-
protected forest strips is highly developed. In such cases, leskhozes issue permits without realistically
assessing  the  companies'  capacity  for  transporting  logged  wood.  As  a  result,  violations  have  become
inevitable, with apparently no one to blame. There are reasons to believe that in many cases there is a
blatant collusion between forest users and leskhoz employees.

10

The  same  applies  to  a  number  of  prohibited  technologies  and  logging  types  (especially  terrace
loggings in mountainous areas of the Far East and field cuttings) carried out as clear cuttings in areas so
remote from processors and consumers that real clear cutting under such conditions becomes insolvent.

d) issuing cutting permits based on dubious (or wrong) interpretations of forest management laws

and regulations.

This  is  a  multi-faceted  widespread  practice  with  regional  peculiarities.  For  example,  when
measuring how steep the logging site slope is (which determines whether logging should be permitted
here  or  not),  the  slope  should  be  measured  from  the  top  border  to  the  lower  border  of  the  plot.
Depending on how the logging plot is located along the slope, the steepness can be either emphasised
or  concealed.  When  measuring  the  sides  of  logging  sites,  in  case  the  slope  is  over  6  degrees,  the
measurements  should  be  emended.  The  size  of  the  officially  declared  volume  of  wood  at  the  site
depends on whether or not the above has been performed. A large number of violations have to do with
interpretations of the Instructions on Thinning Cutting, particularly in the case of regeneration and re-
formation cuttings.

7.  Entering  deliberate  amendments  into  forest  management  documentation,  formally

allowing cuttings otherwise prohibited.

The  most  frequent  kind  of  violation  is  the  exaggeration  (or  invention)  of  the  degree  to  which  a
forest is afflicted with pests or diseases, so that immediate selective or clear felling is necessary. Such
incidents  are  quite  frequent.  We  encountered  them  in  all  the  regions  studied.  The  selection  of  stands
and  the  volume  of  such  fellings  depend  exclusively  on  the  impertinence  of  a  particular  leskhoz
administrator.  Although  the  sylvipathological  condition  of  the  forests  should  be  assessed  by  an
experienced sylvipathologist, formally independent from the leskhoz this is not the case in all areas. In
reality,  leskhozes  rarely  have  any  problems  prescribing  cuttings  'to  restore  forest  health'  (sanitary
cuttings).

The documents regulating the allocation and permission for logging are stored in the leskhoz, the
sylvipathological department and/or the forestry administration of the region. They do not transcend the
walls of the interested agency. Due to this it is often hard to determine whether the violations have
occurred at the point of preparation or actual felling.

*********************************
CASE:
Thus,  for  many  years  Gastello  leskhoz  in  Sakhalin  has  been  exporting  large  volumes  (7136.7
cubic  meters  in  1999)  of  top-quality  spruce  sawwood  to  Japan.  Normally  this  is  one  or  two  lower
pieces  of  large  straight  trunks.  However,  the  leskhoz  logs  such  wood  primarily  in  the  course  of
selective  sanitary  cuttings.  To  log  wood  of  the  same  quality  and  in  the  same  quantity,  mostly  healthy
trees  have  to  be  felled,  which  implies  a  bold  violation  of  the  Sanitary  Rules  for  the  Forests  of  the
Russian Federation.

Another  example  is  selective  sanitary  cuttings  on  the  Karelian  Isthmus  where  according  to
Felling ticket # 92 of the Vyborg leskhoz dated April 9, 1997 the firewood output was expected to be
about 1.5%, which is impossible in case of high quality allocation and tapping of a sanitary cutting. An
independent multilateral check in three leskhozes discovered several dozens of such felling tickets for
the total volume of more than 100,000 cubic meters of timber.

11

******************************************
Ordered allocation of cuttings occurs in connection to alleged changes in the health condition of
forests and often serves not only the interests of leskhozes but the interests of forest consumers as well.

************************************
CASE:
For example in 1998 workers of one of the forestry units (leskhozes) in the Republic Bouryatya
took representative from NGOs for businessmen from Moscow and started reporting that all the papers
about the "lethal" disease of a Siberian Pine forest plot were almost ready. Papers for the cutting were
also ready, but as they claimed the timber was healthy and of the highest quality. They offered to go to
the  forest  plot  in  question  and  judge  for  themselves.  For  your  information  we  can  tell  you  that  the
Forestry  Code  of  the  Russian  Federation  prohibits  final  cuttings  in  the  Siberian  Pine  forests.  Only
thinning and felling of ill and dead trees are allowed in such forests.

CASE;
Another example came to us from the Kikinsky leskhoz in the Republic of Buryatia 1999).
On  November  10,  1998  the  Kikinsky  leskhoz  issued  felling  ticket  #106  to  the  "Baikal  Forest
Company"  Ltd.  to  carry  out  a  regeneration  cutting  in  the  block  23  of  the  Verkhne-Itantsinsky  forest
area. The cutting was supposed to be 272m3/ha of merchantable wood with the stock of growing timber
280m3/ha according to the forest inventory materials. That meant a clear cutting in a forest with the
basic  density  equal  to  0.8.  The  on-stump  wood  allocation  was  to  be  free  according  to  the  lease
contract. By the time the felling ticket was actually issued, the lease contract had not passed the State
registration,  which  meant  that  according  to  the  Forest  Code  the  contract  was  void.  However,  the
privileges  given  to  the  lessee  remained.  Due  to  the  fact  that  this  cutting  was  not  provided  by  the
forestry  project  (forest  inventory)  for  the  territory,  rented  by  the  Baikal  Forest  Company  Ltd,  the
leskhoz informed the company about the possibility of revoking their felling ticket. This means that the
felling ticket was first issued and only after that they started to make sure whether they could issue this
document.  No  wonder  that  by  the  time  the  leskhoz  decided  to  withdraw  the  felling  ticket  the  forest
cutting  in  the  area  had  started  and  was  already  at  full  force.  The  company  found  itself  in  a  strange
position.  If  the  felling  ticket  was  withdrawn,  it  would  simple  to  acknowledge  the  felling  activities
unsanctioned  and  then,  in  addition  to  huge  penalties,  it  would  be  punished  under  Article  260  of  the
Russian Federation Criminal Code "Illegal Cutting of Trees and Bushes".

The company decided to fight for this forest plot, which was not difficult for Mr. Pruidze, because
he, the Head of the Baikal Forest Company had very good relationships with the highest bosses of the
Forestry  Ministry  in  the  Republic  of  Buryatia.  So,  on  December  7,  1998  the  Baikal  Forest  Company
sent  letter  #781  to  the  Forestry  Ministry  of  Buryatia  with  a  request  to  issue  a  felling  ticket  for
regeneration  cutting  in  the  above  mentioned  forest  plot  (the  ticket  had  been  issued  almost  a  month
before).  According  to  a  resolution  of  December  8,  1998  (the  next  day  after  the  letter  was  sent,  an
awfully short time to consider a forest company request) deputy minister A.V. Martynov orders to the
leskhoz  to  permit  a  clear  sanitary  cutting.  He  only  ordered  to  arrange  a  forest  pathology  research
because  logging  in  this  place  was  not  included  in  the  forest  inventory.  If  we  translate  it  into  plain
English then the main idea of the whole affair would be that if one cannot cut wood here but has a very
strong desire to do so, one can arrange a clear  cutting if it is shown that the forest is sick. The same
day,  that  is  December  8,  1998,    forest  pathology  expert  A.Y.  Chernyaev  and  forester  Y.I.  Shtayer
completed  an  Examination  act  of  forest  pathology  research  in  this  forest  plot.  This  research  showed
that  the  forest  had  fulfilled  its  water  protection,  environmental  and  other  functions,  and  now  it
obstructed the growth and development of the young stand.

12

From these materials, including set of special tables it was obvious that forest needs a sanitary
clear cutting. In particular it was shown that on all 5 sample areas studied, exactly 100% of all trees
were attributed to the third condition category (very weak). The cause of the weakness was 'core rot' of
an unknown origin. Obviously, the task presented to the executors was not clear enough, because after
the research it was recommended to carry out a regeneration cutting with mandatory labelling of the
trees subject to felling activities, instead of a sanitary clear cutting. The papers written after the forest
pathology research were filled with serious violations.

On December 11, 1998 the Forestry Ministry of the Republic of Buryatia issued permit #1319 to
carry out regeneration cutting in compartment 23, allotment 15 with the total area of 13 ha. The permit
was issued based on the Examination act of December 8, 1998. Nevertheless, the leskhoz changed the
felling  ticket  to  arrange  a  sanitary  clear  cutting.  The  Buryatia  Forestry  Ministry  never  issued  an
official  permit  to  carry  out  a  sanitary  clear  cutting.  Obviously,  the  leskhoz  had  already  changed  the
felling ticket on December 8 or 9 upon receiving Mr. Martynov's order, not waiting for the necessary
permits to be prepared.

**********

Very often the figures showing the specie composition and density of forest stands are not given
correctly,  which  makes  it  possible  to  arrange  more  intensive  cuttings  or  carry  out  cuttings  in  forest
stands with a significant share of valuable tree species with no appropriate limitations.

Along with such rather simple and very widely spread schemes there are other more sophisticated
ones.  For  example,  on  the  Sakhalin  foresters  very  often  forge  records  of  introduction  of  changes  into
forest inventory materials. For instance, to carry out a cutting on a steep slope (banned by the Regional
cutting-practice rules) a forester from the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk forges a document. In this document, he
asserts that the slope is not really as steep as it was recorded in the forest inventory materials and that it
is suitable for logging. The fact is that the Forest Felling Regulations refer to slopes in general and say
nothing  about  the  slope  on  loggers'  roads.  The  difference  between  these  two  is  the  same  as  the
difference between the slope of the hills and the slope of the road running between the hills. The same
situation is quite common for many other leskhozes of the Sakhalinsk Region.

We  have  some  rough  estimates,  but  according  to  them  at  least  20%  of  intermediate  felling  in
Russia (i.e. at least 5 million m3 in 1999) are illegal due to decisions drawn to justify violations of the
existing legislation.

8. Intentional mistakes of Forest Inventory

Forest inventory organised partially according to the existing legislation and partially according
to the illegal interests of the client has been a usual practice in Russia for the last decades. The fact is
that when organising any forest inventory, it becomes necessary to determine what and how one might
cut  during  the  following  10  years  and  in  some  cases  during  much  larger  periods  of  time.  That's  why
agreements  between  logging  companies  (including  leskhozes)  and  forest  inventors  are  a  common
practice in Russia. However, in recent years a few new details were introduced into this system. Under
the Provisions of a lease, a year after the transfer agreement was signed each lessee should present to
the renter a plan of final felling operations and other forestry operations in the rented plot of the forest

13

fund. If the term of lease is 2 to 5 years, the lessee should present a plan of cuttings. If a forestry area (a
part of sylvicultural enterprise) is leased in parts, especially if the parts belong to different holders, the
plan of felling operations is designed for each part separately. As a result, the total volume of cuttings
for all the rented sites together is very often higher than the volume allowed, adopted and passed EIA
for the area in general. According to the legislation the timber volume for forest management have to
be  previously  set  for  the  whole  leskhoz.  Under  the  existing  legislation  no  check  is  required  to  see
whether the sum of volumes of timber produced by these separate plots correspond to the officially set
volume  for  the  whole  leskhoz.  There  is  strong  reason  to  believe  that  such  changes  in  the  forest
inventory never take place without appropriate investments on the part of interested partners.

Traditionally wood stock on the plot is underestimated during forest inventory as well as forest
density  is  overestimated.  Very  often  there  are  'mistakes'  in  the  species  composition  or  age
determination. Such violations and 'mistakes' are common forest inventory practice in Russia.

It  does  not  seem  possible  to  assess  the  amount  of  logging  resulted  from  such  violations  and

'mistakes'.

9. Forest cuttings carried out with abuse of the existing legislation.

a) overlogging by volume and area.

Overlogging by volume is more characteristic for non-clear cuttings with allocation of wood by
quantity.  In  this  case  timber  consumers  take  advantage  of  the  weak  points  of  legislation  and,  in
particular, the absence of a procedure of true assessment of logged material quantity. Under the rules
that are effective now, volumes of logged wood are determined by wood storage made by the logger or
by other information presented again by the logger. Hence, if the logger does not show everything, or
does not record the true volumes, then overlogging remains unnoticed. One can prove that overlogging
has  really  taken  place  only  by  counting  the  stumps,  but  the  existing  legislation  describes  such  a
procedure only partially and does not mention it as being mandatory, for such occasions. The result is
that in all regions where such cuttings take place (for example the Leningrad Region, Karelia, Buryatia,
and the Khabarovsk region) average overlogging reaches 30 to 40%.

Overlogging  very  often  takes  place  under  allocation  of  wood  on  the  stump  with  the  individual
labelling  of  every  tree  that  is  to  be  cut.  The  problem  is  that  the  label  does  not  have  any  security
categories. Moreover, timber consumers themselves long ago started labelling and allocating trees for
cutting without leskhozes. In such a situation it will not be too difficult to mark additional trees. From
our  experience  we  know  that  such  overlogging  seldom  exceeds  15-20%.  The  existing  forestry
legislation has absolutely no leverage to fight this type of overlogging.

Overlogging  by  area  is  something  that  cannot  be  contained  very  often.  Such  overlogging  often
takes  place  due  to  mistakes  foresters  make  while  allocating  wood.  The  fact  is  that  forester  get  paid
dearly for such 'mistakes'. The second variant is when the felling operation passes beyond the borders
of the forest plot allocated for cutting. While cutting of one or several trees beyond the borders of the
logging  site  is  a  common  practice  almost  everywhere,  illegal  cuttings  of  larger  amounts  of  wood  are
typical for those regions where volumes of logged timber are very large and for the regions situated far
from  the  supervising  agencies.  For  example,  in  1998  in  the  Pervomaysky  leskhoz  we  watched
construction of a new road leading toward logging sites that have not been allocated, yet. The logging
company that constructed the road at the same time picked up all trees fit for cutting in the range of 30

14

meters on both sides of the roads without any permission to do this. Judging by the way the logways in
this  region  looked,  such  a  practice  is  a  general  rule  here.  In  the  same  region  we  encountered  an
occasion  when  a  company  paid  a  forester  and  logged  wood  500  meters  beyond  the  borders  of  its
logging site. The same situation can be observed in other regions as well.

Another widely spread example is the cutting of trees beyond the borders of a particular logging
site  together  with  illegally  move  of  the  borders  to  cover  the  fact  that  a  violation  has  actually  taken
place.  Since  the  borders  of  a  logging  site  are  usually  marked  with  nothing  more  than  a  hard-to-see
cursor and small columns in the corners, it is very easy to move such a border. Such violations always
remain unpunished because it is almost impossible to prove the company's connection to this violation.

In  several  leskhozes  of  the  Leningrad  region  we  met  a  situation  when  timber  logged  over  the
officially permitted amounts, were given to foresters under a corresponding preliminary agreement in
order to 'build good relationships for the future'.

According  to  our  estimates,  such  overlogging  reaches  1.5-2  million  m3  annually.  It  is  very
difficult  to  discover  such  violations  during  independent  checks  because  there  is  no  access  to  the
necessary forestry documents and because there is always a covert agreement between leskhoz officers
and logging companies.

b) change of composition and structure of chosen tree species.
It  is  a  very  common  violation  in  a  situation  when  a  logging  company  can  allocate  wood  by
himself.  Such  violations  are  very  wide  spread  in  the  regions  with  several  tree  species  differing
dramatically from one another in terms of price (centre and northwest of the European part of Russia,
the  southern  part  of  the  Far  East,  the  Northern  Caucasus).  These  violations  do  not  usually  lead  to
significant  fluctuations  of  logged  wood  volumes.  It  does  not  seem  possible  to  assess  what  amount  of
wood is being logged when such violations occur.

c) non-observable cutting technologies and tree removal rules.
If  an  officially  adopted  technological  map  (map  of  skidding  roads  and  truck  road  etc.  on  the
logging  site)  does  not  provide  for  economically  efficient  and  technologically  simple  methods  to  log
wood or organise timber removal, logging companies usually resort to different violations. Generally,
they change logway construction plans, build skidding roads and logways through the areas where such
things are prohibited by law (for instance, along waterways), change location of technological sectors
and so on. Very often such violations take place with no reference to heads of said logging company,
meaning  that  this  is  only  an  initiative  of  workers  (direct  executors).  Usually  these  violations  do  not
directly affect volumes of logged wood.

CONCLUSION

The  experience  of  the  last  years  reveals  that,  unfortunately,  it  has  become  a  usual  practice  of
forest felling to ignore the existing legislation. For example, in June 2000, at one of the logging sites of
the Dalnegorsk  district  in  Primorye  region  we  detected  a  forest  felling  operation  that  was  carried  out
outside  of  the  borders  of  the  permitted  logging  site.  This  was  conducted  in  a  remote  part  of  an
allotment where a few Korean Pines were cut down (although, as the loggers said they were forbidden
to cut Korean Pines). In the same area log-ways ran along a stream. There were other violations, but
none of the workers saw anything wrong, saying, We've cut down a couple of Korean Pines. So what?!
Cutting a few Korean Pines won't do any harm. This phrase says everything about what wood loggers

15

think  about  breaches  of  the  law.  A  few  is  nothing  and  we  may  cut  down  a  few  trees.  This  amount
depends  on  a  particular  person  and  his  or  her  conscience,  if  there  is  any  at  all.  Unfortunately,  the
attitude  of  the  supervising  agencies  toward  this  issue  is  the  same,  not  taking  into  account  the  cases
when fidelity to one's principles becomes something that can be easily bought and sold.

Last notes
In 1999 Russia exported about 29 million  m3 of raw timber, and in round wood Russia exports
more  than  a  half  of  timber  logged  both  legally  and  with  violations  of  the  existing  legislation.
Considerable income from the forest export stimulates forest felling both legal and illegal. The majority
of  companies  buying  wood  from  Russia  either  don't  take  interest  in  or  prefer  not  to  think  about  the
origin  of  timber  they  buy,  because  they  think  that  it  really  matters  only  in  Russia  Abroad  all  timber,
even stolen, becomes legally clean. That's why it doesn't seem possible to solve the problem of illegal
forest felling operations until both buyers and sellers of forest products close the illegally logged timber
from entering the market.
