An evaluation of the impacts of specific anthropogenic
noise types on cetaceans:
New types of guidelines needed to protect whales from ocean noise

by Michael Stocker for Greenpeace

Executive Summary

It  is  well  established  that  certain  anthropogenic  noises  have  a  severe  effect  on
whales.  Many  sounds  that  humans  introduce  into  the  sea  today  are  without
precedent  in  the  evolutionary  history  of  marine  mammals  and  other  ocean  life.
Seismic testing associated with oil and gas exploration, military SONAR, and other
industrial  sources  of  ocean  noise  have  injured  or  killed  dolphins  and  whales  in
many instances.  Additionally, behavioral impacts can also be severe, with animals
interrupting  feeding,  nursing,  or  reproductive  activity  to  flee  from  disruptive  or
painful sounds.  There is also evidence that whales may be subject to “masking,”
where  some  types  of  noises  interfere  with  their  ability  to  communicate  with  each
other.  As the military and industrial producers of these sounds are required by law
in  some  countries  to  prevent  impacts  to  marine  mammals,  there  has  been
considerable debate and litigation in response to this continuing problem.

Various  mitigation  schemes  have  been  proposed,  but  they  have  not  proven
effective  in  eliminating  harm  to  whales.    Despite  a  wealth  of  information
demonstrating the need to address multiple characteristics of sound, such as form,
frequency,  and  periodicity,  mitigation  levels  have  thus  far  focused  only  on  signal
amplitude, or volume. Many of the studies have also been focused on physiological
thresholds such as “threshold shift” using sinusoidal-derived signals which may not
accurately  reflect  the  types  of  anthropogenic  noises  to  which  whales  are
exposed.1,2  Mitigation levels based on these thresholds and signal types are often
higher than known behavioral thresholds. It is clear from the literature that marine
mammals  avoid  certain  types  of  signals  at  significantly  lower  amplitudes  than
naturally occurring signals or other types, frequencies and forms of anthropogenic
signals.

This paper presents data on signal-specific biological responses of cetaceans and
calls  for  incorporation  of  signal  types  as  well  as  decibel  levels  when  establishing
noise exposure criteria for whales.  Given the existing evidence that cetaceans are
adversely impacted by a range of noises far below current mitigation levels, a more
precautionary approach is needed.

1.0   Overview

The increase in human population density over the last 50 – 75 years has caused
unexpected  environmental  impacts  throughout  the  globe.  The  ocean,  once
believed  to  be  so  expansive  as  to  be  immune  from  the  small  scales  of  human
enterprise  is  now  a  looming  conservation  concern.  It  is  no  longer  enough  to  just
manage  commercial  fisheries  in  terms  of  catch  quotas  and  harvest  practices;  the
very  habitat  of  these  fisheries  needs  to  be  conserved  under  the  rubric  of  “eco-
system  management.”  Considerations  of  predator/prey  relationships,  food  stock
viability,  coastal  wetlands  management,
toxic  pollutants,  bycatch,  habitat
protection,  and  global  warming  all  play  into  contemporary  fisheries  management
concerns.

This recent framing arose rapidly following the collapse of the long standing view
that  the  ocean  was  both  an  unlimited  food  source  and  a  bottomless  dumping
ground, which had resulted in unrestricted or poorly regulated ocean practices.3 As
fisheries  catch  levels  increased  and  the  effects  of  accumulated  ocean  dumping
and  runoff  grew  more  visible,  it  became  rapidly  clear  that  the  ocean  was  more
vulnerable  to  human  activities  than  was  once  thought.  Problems  with  sustainable
yields  became  apparent  as  the  various  commercial  fisheries  ceased  being
economically viable due to low catch rates.4 But other eco-system problems such
as the impacts of ocean plastic refuse on zooplankton,5 mercury concentrations in
animal  tissues6  and  depletion  of  coastal  wetlands7  came  as  more  of  a  surprise
because  these  elements  of  the  ecosystem  became  evident  only  through  broader
examination  of  the  interdependence  of  commercial  fisheries  and  the  habitat  that
supported them.

One of the more recent surprises is the impact that human generated noise has on
marine ecosystems.8 Despite decades of ship-shock trials, naval training exercises
with  explosives  and  even  ocean-based  atomic  bomb  tests,  significant  public
concern  with  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  anthropogenic  noise  did  not
arise until the introduction of the Acoustic Thermography of Ocean Climate (ATOC)
program (originally proposed in the early 1990’s).9  Leading up to ATOC, the Heard
Island  Feasibility  Test  (HIFT)  was  done  without  public  scrutiny,  and  the
researchers did not notice any adverse impacts on marine mammals.10

Neither  of  these  programs  seemed  to  have  an  immediate  catastrophic  impact  on
marine  mammals,  but  the  question  was  raised  as  to  whether  the  increase  in  the
ocean  noise  floor  as  a  consequence  of  ATOC  and  other  introduced  noises  might
have  a  long-term  deleterious  effect on  ocean  habitat.  Nonetheless,  the  ways  that
anthropogenic  noises  affected  ocean  habitat  were  not  deeply  studied  or
understood, so human acoustical engagement in the sea continued to increase –
with  nominal  consideration  for  the  biological  impacts  that  these  engagements
might have.

In  1996  the  US  Navy  began  a  process  of  public  scoping  meetings  to  develop  an
Environmental Impact Statement on the global application of Low Frequency Active
Sonar,  submitting  a  Draft  Overseas  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (SURTASS
LFA  DOEIS/EIS)  by  July  1999.11  Perhaps  it  was  a  matter  of  timing,  or  the  global
scope of the project, but this document caught the attention of the American public
who  came  out  in  huge  numbers  to  object  to  the  program.12  Public  alarm  with
SURTASS  and  related  programs  was  increased  by  the  March  2000  mass
stranding event of beaked whales in the Bahamas as a consequence of U.S. Naval
exercises.13  The  Bahamas  event  provided  the  most  compelling  evidence  to  date
that  Active  Sonar  has  the  potential  to  be  ototoxic  to  whales.  The  event  also
illuminated  the  distinct  differences  between  the  effects  of  Low  Frequency  Sonar
being  proposed  in  the  SURTASS  LFA  program,  and  the  new  tactical  Mid
Frequency sonars responsible for the beaked whale mass stranding.

In  the  SURTASS  LFA  program,  the  mitigation  level  was  set  at  a  Received  Level
(RL)  of  180dB  (re:1(cid:0) Pa).14,15  Meanwhile,  the  received  levels  in  the  Bahamas
stranding were either “well below 180 dB”  16 or between 160 dB and 180dB17 – in
any event, generally below the SURTASS LFA mitigation level of 180dB.

This disparity between mitigation levels and biological response levels to different
signal  types  is  but  one  indication  that  marine  mammals  respond  to  many
characteristics  of  anthropogenic  noise.  Received  level  is  but  one  characteristic,
and  is  less  strongly  correlated  to  behavioral  response  than  other  factors.
Nonetheless recommended mitigation levels often tend to hinge on exposure levels
alone, without regard to other signal characteristics.18

This paper will examine various types of anthropogenic noises framed by how the
noises evoke biological responses in various marine mammals or how the noises
might interfere with biologically significant communication channels. Based on this
examination,  the  paper  makes  recommendations  for  better  crafting  mitigation
criteria  to  match  biological  responses  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  specific
noise.

2.0 Biological Responses

For  purposes  of  this  examination,  “biological  responses”  are  grouped  into  four
categories based on how readily observable the response is. There will necessarily
be overlaps  in  these  categories,  as  well  as  ambiguity  in  observable  responses  in
any  of  the  categories.  These  ambiguities  are  a  product  of  many  aspects  of  the
observation including time frame and duration of the observation; natural or captive
settings;  habituation  to  the  stimulus;  learned  responses  from  prior  situations  or
signals  that  influence  exposure  in  the  observation  setting;19  assumptions  by  the
observer;  other  complexities  of  the  observation  settings,  and  the  simple  fact  that
the subjects are animals, not input devices.

Page 2

Subject to these caveats, the biological response categories for the purpose of this
paper  are:  Synergistic  effects;  Masking  of  biologically  significant  sounds;
Phonotaxis – such as startle and avoidance responses and other cognitive effects
of  harassment;  and  ototoxic  responses  including  temporary  threshold  shift  and
permanent tissue damage.

2.1 Synergistic Effects

Synergistic effects of anthropogenic noise exposure are the most difficult biological
impact  to  observe  or  measure.  This  is  aggravated  by  the  fact  that  there  are  few
known  baselines  from  a  time  when  wild  animals  were  not  subjected  to
anthropogenic noise.  Synergistic effects, by definition, are not clearly defined, but
include everything from the compromise of the individual organism as a product of
synergistic external stressors, to population declines due to habitat compromise or
individual
displacements  (and
organisms).  This  later  synergistic  condition  has  been  observed  when  animals
abandon  an  area  subject  to  noise,  repopulating  it  after  the  noise  source  is
removed.  20 In this case the area in question was Guerrero Negro Lagoon in Baja
California,  abandoned  by  gray  whales  during  the  operation  of  salt  works  in  the
lagoon and repopulated after the salt works were shut down.

the  consequent  synergistic  effects  on

the

Determining  the  synergistic  effects  of  noise  on  health  is  not  as  clear  cut.  While
markers for stress such as cortisol levels in the blood or plasma catecholamine in
urine  are  cues  to  the  fact  that  an  animal  is  subject  to  short  or  intermediate  term
health  effects,21  tracking  the  effects  of  temporary  but  periodic  noise  exposures  in
the  long  term  is  highly  challenging  and  often  inconclusive,  particularly  in  wild
populations.  Similarly,  determining  the  synergistic  effects  of  chronic,  persistent  or
increasing noise,  (such  as  the  increase  in ambient noise  levels  in  the  sea due to
shipping noise) is difficult because there are few opportunities to study established
control  populations  in  an  ocean  increasingly  saturated  with  shipping  noise.  This
may be changing through “common sense” mitigations such as relocating shipping
lanes away from sensitive resident marine mammal areas. Efforts akin to this may
provide some much needed data on the effects of shipping noise and the recovery
of resident populations.22

As  a  consequence  of  the  inconclusive  nature  of  synergistic  effects  of  noise  on
animal  welfare,  mitigation  policy  may  often  fall  under  the  rubrics  of  “common
sense” or “how would you like it if…” qualified by what is known about the subject
species’ hearing and vocalization ranges.

2.2  Masking

Masking  concerns  about  introduced  noise  are  framed  either  in  terms  of
interference  with  animal  communication  signals,  or  interference  with  other
biologically important signals such as the important sounds of habitat dimensions,
sources  of  danger,  or  the  sounds  of  predators  or  prey.  In  a  captive  setting,  a
beluga  whale  modified  its  vocalizations  to  accommodate  natural  noise  source
masking,  23 so there is likely some latitude to adapt to variable noise levels in the
sea  by  other  species  as  well.  In  this  case  the  beluga  shifted  its  vocalization
frequency out of the range of dominant ambient noise.

For high frequency echolocation and social vocalizations of odontocetes, this may
be a common adaptation, but in the low frequency, long distance vocalizations of
mysticetes,  changing  the  frequency  of  the  communication  channel  is  less  of  an
option.24

A  starting  point  in  the  evaluation  of  masking  effects  involves  establishing  the
ranges of biologically important sounds of the subject animals – from vocalizations,
communication channels, and passive acoustical evaluation of their environment.25
This  information  may  be  used  as  a  “base  sheet”  to  overlay  “received  levels”  of
anthropogenic  noise  to  determine  where  the  respective  ranges  overlap  in
frequency  and  amplitude.  The  effectiveness  of  this  strategy  is  based  on  the
assumption  that  the  subject  animals  segregate  useful  biological  sounds  through
frequency and amplitude discrimination only.

2.3 Phonotaxis – behavioral responses to introduced noise

Phonotaxis is a response to an introduced noise that can be noticed by observing
behavioral  changes  in  the  subject  animal  as  a  consequence  of  the  noise.
Behavioral  changes  can  include  aversion/avoidance,  attraction,  or  modification  of
ongoing behaviors. Any of these behaviors represent a potential risk to the extent
and  the  degree  of  the  particular  response.  In  the  simplest  terms,  any  of  these
behaviors expend an animal’s “natural response energy budget” as a consequence
of  an  “unnatural”  stimulus.  There  is  a  biological  cost  when  an  animal  needs  to
modify its behavior or divert from its natural course of travel to avoid noise.26

Behavioral  responses  are  accompanied  by  changes  in  metabolic  functions,  such
as  respiratory  and  heart  rates,  and  other  metabolic  stress  responses.  The
threshold  for  any  behavioral  response  is  not  necessarily  predictable;  threshold  of
ototaxis correlates to activity. A group of whales resting quietly would seem more
likely  to  be  disturbed  by  human  activity  than  whales  that  are  actively  engaged  in
feeding or interacting in social activities.27 The behaviors stimulated by a particular
noise may also not be predictable: a noise that an individual animal avoids in one
instance may attract another individual in another. This accounts for the variability
in net-predator sea lion responses to Acoustic Harassment Devices (AHD) that are
effective  only  until    the  sea  lions  habituate  to  them,  at  which  point  they  become
“dinner bells” for them.28

2.4 Ototoxic and “Acousti-toxic” Effects

It  is  not  surprising  that  marine  mammals  are  vulnerable  to  ear  damage  due  to
explosive  blasts,29  though  it  was  initially  surprising  that  modern  tactical  sonars
were  powerful  enough  to  cause  the  deaths  of  whales.30  As  powerful  as  they  are,
the  manner  in  which  intense  sounds  cause  tissue  damage  is  still  not  entirely
known.  There  is  evidence  that  powerful  low  frequency  signals  can  resonate
cavities  within  the  bodies  of  the  animals.  There  is  also  evidence  that  physical
damage  can  be  caused  by  the  animal’s  reaction  to  the  noise  –  regardless  of
frequency.31  The  existence  of  both  of  these  possibilities  points  to  a  need  to
evaluate auditory thresholds as well as the mechanical effects of high energy noise
on the marine mammal body.

The most dramatic evidence of ototoxic and acoustic-toxic effects has come in the
form  of  multi-species  stranding  incidents  or  other  unusual  mass-avoidance
behavior.  These  have  been  most  often  associated  with  naval  mid-frequency
sonars.32  But  premature  hearing  loss  in  marine  mammals  caused  by  chronic  or
occasional exposure to loud sounds such as seismic airgun surveys 33 or just high
levels  of  anthropogenic  ambient  noise  34  may  also  result  in  the  same  outcome  –
premature mortality.

3.0 Noise Sources and Characteristics

The  “natural”  ocean  is  not  necessarily  a  quiet  place:  weather  conditions,  waves,
turbulence, seismic events, and biological noises are but a few of the contributing
factors  to  ambient  noise  in  ocean  ecosystems.35  Some  of  these  noises  can  be
relatively  loud,  such  as  earthquakes,  volcanic  activity  and  the  breaking  up  of  sea
ice. As these sound sources have been integral to the ocean ambient noise levels
throughout  the  evolution  of  sea  life,  however,  sea  animals  have  presumably
adapted  to  them.  Only  within  the  last  100  years  or  so  has  human  enterprise
contributed to the oceanic soundscape – with noise sources that can be equal to or
significantly  louder  than  natural  sounds.  While  animals  may  have  the  ability  to
adapt  to  some  of  these  sounds,  adaptation  may  be  a  consequence  of  the
introduced sound’s similarity to natural sounds.36 The sound’s characteristics may
also  be  within  the  range  of  natural  sounds  that  do  not  interfere  with  the  animal’s
necessary  acoustic  cues.37  But

anthropogenic sound is not always possible.

 The much quoted “Ross Prediction” alerted us to the fact that ocean ambient noise
as  a  consequence  of  shipping  would  increase  by  0.4  dB/year  from  1950  –  1975
(10dB increase in the 50Hz band) and that low frequency noise in the North Pacific
deep  sound  channel  increased  15  dB  from  1950  -  1975.  38    Ross  was  only
accounting for shipping noise and did not predict the development of new acoustic
technologies  or  the  increase  in  human  uses  of  the  sea  in  addition  to  shipping  –
such as increased dependence on submarine communication for national security,

Page 6

the  expansion  of  seismic  survey  noise  in  the  search  of  outer  continental  shelf  oil
reserves, or the acoustical consequences of offshore industrial processing. Had he
anticipated  these  additional  sources  of  noise,  his  predictions  would  have  been
more even more alarming.

Anthropogenic noise can be grouped in two categories “intentional” and “incidental”
noises.  (Partial  list  in  Appendix  Table  1  and  Table  2,  respectively.)  These
categories  help define  mitigation  strategies, inasmuch  as  intentional  noises  might
be tailored for reduced biological impact. Incidental noises, on the other hand, can
only be mechanically attenuated or timed to occur for least biological impact.

The dominant sources of ocean noise pollution are:

•  Military  operations,

including  communication,  surveillance,  navigation,

sonars, transportation, and “ordinance” (explosives).

•  Ocean seismic exploration and mapping.
•  Commercial  cargo  vessels  including  propulsion,  hull  coupled  mechanical

noise and navigation sonar.

•  Petroleum and minerals extraction, including drilling and mining operations.
•  Marine  based  civil  engineering  projects  such  as  bridge  building  and

pipelines.

•  Offshore  industrial  processes  such  as  factory  boats  and  Liquefied  Natural

Gas plants.

•  Marine fisheries and aquaculture including processing, trawling, and use of

“Acoustic Harassment Devices (AHD’s).

Each  of  these  sources  produces  an  array  of  noises  that  compromise  various
environments in the sea – from ports and harbors, to coastal waters, to the deep
sea.

The  sounds  produced  by  these  sources  are  not  just  “noise,”  rather  they  can  be
qualified  by  characteristics  of  amplitude,  frequency  and  bandwidth,  form  (impulse
or burst, fast rise time, sinusoidal, ramped or square wave) and periodicity (single
event, pulsed or rhythmic, intermittent, or continuous). These characteristics are all
features  of  how  a  given  noise  is  used  (e.g.  for  long  or  short  distance
these
communication,  surveillance  or  biological  deterrence).  Each  of
characteristics  will  also  have  some  bearing  on  how  the  sound  induces  biological
responses in various marine mammals.

When  crafting  mitigation  guidelines  for  anthropogenic  noise,  the  subject  noise
needs  to  be  evaluated  by  how  it  induces  the  biological  responses  outlined  in
Section 2 above in terms of these characteristics.

Page 7

3.1 Amplitude

Of primary concern in the evaluation of any sound is whether it is loud enough – or
has enough amplitude—to detect. Amplitude plays into the detection “threshold” or
sensitivity  of  the  receiver.  Any  receiver  –  biological  or  technological  –  will  have  a
limited dynamic range, defined as the range between the detection threshold and
the overload or “saturation” threshold.  The favorable operating range for receivers
rides comfortably between these extents with enough gain to hear above the noise,
and  enough  “overhead”  to  handle  signal  transients.  Any  noise  (unwanted  sound)
will  limit  the  dynamic  range  of  the  receiver  by  how  much  it  impinges  on  the
receiver’s dynamic range – up to the point where the noise meets or exceeds the
overload  threshold  of  the  receiver.  Technological  receivers  can  often  be  adjusted
at overload to accommodate the saturation point. Biological receivers do not adjust
as  easily  or  recover  as  readily  and  may  become  temporarily  or  permanently
damaged at the overload point.

Until  the  introduction  of  anthropogenic  sounds  in  the  ocean,  overload  was  not  a
common  concern  for  biological  receivers.  Thus  any  noise  that  approaches  or
exceeds  the  amplitude  of  naturally  occurring  sounds  should  be  evaluated  for
mitigation.

Page 8

3.2 Frequency

An obvious categorization of noise sources after their amplitude is their frequency
and  band  width.    Human  sound  perception  priorities  typically  group  sound
frequencies  into  “Infrasonic,”  “Sonic,”  and  “Ultrasonic”  categories—describing
frequencies  that  are  below  human  pitch  discrimination,  within  human  pitch
discrimination  range,  or  above  our  ability  to  hear.  From  the  standpoint  of  animal
communication  these  human  oriented  categories  are  arbitrary.  Thus,  by  loose
convention,  marine  mammal  communication  sounds  fall  into  three  general  bands
established  by  their  biological  purposes:  low,  mid  and  high  frequencies.  Low
frequencies  are typically  considered 1kHz and  below  –  corresponding  to  the  long
distance  vocalizations  of  Mysticetes.  The  mid  frequency  band  lies  between  1kHz
and  10kHz,    corresponding  to  short  range  social  signals  of  both  Mysticetes  and
Odontocetes.  High  frequencies  begin at around 10kHz  and extend up  to  200kHz;
they are used for short-range echolocation and perhaps communication.

Receivers  by  necessity  are  limited  in  the  frequencies  and  width  of  their  “pass
band.” The pass band is the frequency range of signals that a receiver can “hear.”
Signals below or above the pass band frequencies are “rejected” or not heard.  A
limited  pass  band  allows  for  the  required  information  to  be  processed  without
interference  from  noise  outside  of  the  pass  band.  Technological  receivers  often
have finely tuned pass-bands tailored to their specific purpose. With the exception
of a few anurans and arthropods,39 biological pass-bands are typically fairly wide,
admitting  signals  for  multiple  purposes,  from  communication,  to  hunting  or
foraging,  to  surveillance.  Mammalian  hearing  is  prioritized  (perhaps  uniquely)40  to
frequency by way of their cochlea. It is not uncommon for mammals to have a 7 –
9  octave  pass-band.41,  42  This  wide  pass-band  allows  for  diverse  use  of  sound
perception but also exposes them to a broader range of noise interference.

In  the  simplest  terms,  the  potential  for  biological  response  occurs  when  the
frequency  of  introduced  signal  is  above  the  auditory  threshold  of  the  subject
animal’s perceptual band (see Chart 1). The extent of the biological response will
be somewhat dependent on how far the signal sits above this threshold – from the
animal  “noticing”  or  being  aware  of  the  signal,  to  the  signal  masking  biologically
important sounds, to the signal interfering with or distracting the animal’s ‘normal’
behavior,  to  the  signal  damaging  the  animal’s  hearing  system  or  tissues  (as  in
Sections  2  above).  The  two  ship  spectrograms  in  Chart  1  illustrate  broad  band
continuous  noise  sources  against  the  auditory  thresholds  of  bottlenose  dolphin
Tursiops truncatus43  and  the  humpback  whale Megaptera novaeangliae 44  (model
derived). The chart has a logrhythmic display of frequency along the “x” axis, and
signal amplitude on decibels (re:1(cid:0) Pascal) on the “y” axis. For level reference, the
chart also includes contoured level indicator lines across the entire chart spectrum.
(These  contour  lines  are  derived  from  ocean  ambient  noise  levels  found  in  G.M.
Wentz 45 which refer to natural ambient noise levels as a consequence of weather
conditions.) The chart illustrates that both ship noises have the potential to invoke
any of these biological responses.46

It is important to remember that any noise source with a fundamental frequency will
also have a harmonic component which is a product of the complexity of the signal.

More complex signals such as Audio Frequency Shift Key (AFSK) communication
signals include the various frequencies defined in the code key, the interaction of
the  frequencies  by  way  of  summation  and  differential  combination  tones,  and
higher harmonics that are a product of the switching frequency between the tones,
as  well  as  the  transients  generated  by  the  switching  speed  between  the  FSK
frequencies. (See Chart 4)

The  AFSK  signal  represented  in  Chart  4  represents  an  entirely  new  type  of
underwater  acoustical  signal  that  has  no  biological  equivalency.  While  there  is
some  history  for  the  use  of  coding  schemes  that  utilize  “analog”  signals  such  as
the Dual-Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) signals (as in the common telephone key-
pad  signals),  these  “older”  signal  types  use  single  or  multiple  sinusoidal  tones  to
generate the key code which have some biological equivalencies.

The AFSK signal on the other hand is representative of digital modulation schemes
characterized  by  very  fast  switching  speeds,  rapid  signal  rise  times  and
combinations of “carrier” and “modulation” frequencies not found in nature. This is
recognizable in Chart 4 by the high kurtosis (high variability in peak distribution) of
the constituent frequencies.

High  kurtosis  signals  are  not  found  in  nature  and  may  bear  a  clue  into  the
disturbing  qualities  of  these  sounds  –  both  for  humans  as  well  as  for  marine
mammals.  In  the  “sound  perception  dominant”  environment  of  marine  mammals,
these  unnatural  sounds  may  stimulate  biological  responses  that  cannot  be
predicted  from  what  is  known  about  common  biological  responses  to  simple

derived auditory threshold tests on captive animals.

3.3 Form

As  indicated  in  the  preceding  section,  for  a  signal  of  any  given  amplitude,
frequency  or  bandwidth,  not  all  sounds  (or  noises)  are  equivalent.  Some
distinguishing characteristics include: 47

•  Wave  form  –  the  shape  of  the  amplitude  of  the  signal  over  time.  Typically
referring  to  a  single  cycle,  common  synthesized  forms  include  sinusoid,
“square wave” and “sawtooth wave.”

•  Rise time – the speed at which a signal increases in amplitude from some
specified  small  fraction  to  some  specified  larger  fraction  of  the  maximum
value.

•  Crest  factor  –  of  an  oscillating  quantity,  the  ratio  of  the  peak  value  to  the

•

“root mean square” (RMS) value.
Impulse  response  –  the  time  integral  of  force  over  the  time  interval  over
which the force is being applied.

•  Envelope – the time integral of the amplitude of an oscillating signal over the

time interval over which the signal is being applied.

Each  of  these  characteristics  is  found  in  all  acoustical  signals  –  whether
biologically  or  mechanically  generated,  or  electrically  synthesized.  The  significant
difference  between  biological  sounds  and  anthropogenic  sounds  is  in  the

Page 13

quantitative  range  of  each  characteristic.  Biological  systems  are  constrained  by
qualities  and  characteristics  such  as  acoustical  compliance  of  tissues,  acoustical
compliance and impulse response of hearing organs, adapted range of sensitivity
(based  on  habitat  and  niche),  and  required  functional  range  within  habitat  and
niche. Anthropogenic noise sources are not so constrained; they are as loud and
persistent as the energy available to drive them, without biological limitations.

Cetacean  vocalizations  are  either  sinusoidal  based  tonal  signals  or  broad-band
impulsive sounds such as buzzing, creaks, bangs, pops and clicks. Tonal sounds
are  considered  communication  signals,48  and  impulsive  sounds  (often  called
“clicks”)  are  used  for  echolocation  and  inspection.49  These  sounds  can  be
produced  separately  or  in  combinations.  50  Some  of  these  vocalizations  can  be
quite  loud,  but  we  can  assume  that  prior  to  the  introduction  of  anthropogenic
sounds  into  the  marine  environment  that  the  range  of  cetacean  bio-acoustic
adaptations  was  suitable  for  the  sustenance  and  evolution  of  their  life;  that  the
“very loud” signals were loud enough for their purpose, and that animals subject to
hearing these signals have adapted to their amplitude.

Increasing evidence indicates that marine mammals have not so readily adapted to
anthropogenic  sounds.  While  human  generated  sounds  may  also
include
sinusoidal  and  broad-band  impulsive  sounds,  these  sounds  are  increasingly
characterized  by  extremely  fast  rise-times,  high  crest  factors,  lengthy  power
envelopes and various frequency combinations that are entirely alien to nature.

Cetacean “drive fisheries” have been exploiting avoidance responses to such alien,
human  generated  sounds  for  500  years.51  More  recently,  electronics-based
submarine  detection  technology  (ASDIC),  the  precursor  to  modern  sonars,  was
used in the same manner. This system “…frightens the animals, which then swim
very  fast  and  near  the  surface,  making  them  easier  to  see  and  tiring  them  more
quickly.” And “…many whalers reported that the sounds of the ASDIC appeared to
irritate or frighten whales, and … that in the presence of ASDIC whales were more
likely  to  bolt  directly  away  from  the  boats  rather  than  dodge  or  cut  from  side  to
side.”52

There  is  no  record  of  the  received  levels  in  these  reports,  or  any  mention  of  the
signal form, but it is clear that the signals induced a negative biological reaction in
the whales. Consistent with this are the catastrophic biological responses to Anti-
Submarine Warfare (ASW) signals indicated in the Bahamas stranding – at levels
between 160dB and 180dB.53

Other  synthetic  signals  “like  the  sound  of  a  computer  modem”  produced  “severe
discomfort”  in  harbor  porpoises  at  125  dBw.54,55  Additionally,  signals  crafted  to
cause  avoidance  behavior  induced  this  behavior  in  harbor  porpoises  at  Source
Levels  (SL)  of  119dB  (unweighted).  In  this  case,  the  signal  was  a  2.5  kHz
fundamental  sinusoid  with  275ms  bursts  at  a  40%  duty  cycle56  –  similar  in
fundamental  frequency  range  to  mid-frequency  ASW  sonar.    Significantly,  and

Page 14

despite  the  behavioral  response  it  induced,  this  signal  was  also  below  the
dominant hearing range of the subject animal.

It is clear from the above that cetaceans can have negative biological responses to
various  anthropogenic  signals  even  when  the  signals  are  significantly  below
“recommended mitigation levels” – or even below the subject animal’s vocalization
levels. This is particularly the case if the signals do not have form equivalence to
biological signals. This phenomenon may be akin to human reaction to the irksome
sound  of  fingernails  on  a  chalkboard  –  the  very  idea  of  which  can  make  some
people cringe.

3.4 Periodicity

All  of  the  signals  qualified  by  the  characteristics  above  occur  in  a  larger  time
domain;  from  single  events,  to  intermittent  events,  through  pulsed  or  rhythmic
cycles  to  continuous  operation.    Single  or  intermittent  events  are  more  likely  to
startle  an  animal  and  put  them  on  alert  for  the  possibility  that  the  event  “might”
occur  again,  while  continuous  noise  compromises  the  habitat  for  communication
and an animal’s bio-acoustic awareness of their surroundings.

Little  is  known  about  the  synergistic  effects  of  intermittent  or  single  acoustical
events  on  marine  mammals,  but  there  are  many  studies  of  catastrophic  single
acoustical events on whales and other animals.57 Systematic tests on masking or
phonotaxis  consequences  of  “single  event”  acoustical  stimulus  would  be
inconsistent with the definitions of “single event.”

Pulsed  or  rhythmic  acoustical  events  may  or  may  not  affect  animals  as  a
consequence of the rhythm. The biological role of rhythm – or temporal synchrony
–  is  complex.  The  rhythm  of  acoustic  signals  is  a  documented  factor  in  critical
biological functions such as mate choice in some insects58 and birds.59  In humans,
rhythm  serves  in  speech  communication,60  as  well  as  social  and  community
bonding.61 In this context, rhythmic entrainment and synchrony are a characteristic
of humans, but not of other primates62 (i.e. in terms of rhythm, chimpanzees don’t
“swing”).  Lower  primates  do not  have a  social  structure or  a  communication form
that involves group synchrony, and they do not “school” or “flock” like dolphins or
birds. While the author is unaware of studies about synchrony in marine mammals,
marine  mammal  schooling  behavior  (and  dolphin  “play”  behavior)  would  indicate
that  cetaceans  can  entrain  or  synchronize  to  external  stimulus.  Humpback  whale
and  other  mysticete  “codas”  can  be  and  often  are  “rhythmic”  inasmuch  as  they
contain repetitive figures that occur in metered temporal cycles. Recordings taken
from  humpback  whales  in  a  controlled  exposure  experiment  have  demonstrated
that  introduced  rhythmic  sounds  in  the  same  frequency  range  of  an  ongoing
humpback song can disrupt both the rhythm and length of the song.63  The impact
or  significance  of  this  remains  unclear,  but  it  is  possible  that  rhythmic  acoustical
signals 64  –  particularly  ongoing  rhythmic  signals  such  as  navigation  beacons  or

Page 15

seismic surveys– may have a biological impact as a consequence of their rhythm
quite apart from the frequency or amplitude of the signal.

From  a  physiological standpoint,  repetitive  signals  significantly  increase  chinchilla
susceptibility  to  threshold  shift  over  continuous  noise  with  the  same  sound
exposure  level  and  spectral  profile.  In  this  case  the  (recorded  hammer  strike)
impacts (at a repetition rate of 2.25/s) were played to one group. The second group
was subjected to pink noise signal with a spectrum shaped to match the spectrum
of  the  impact  noise  but  run  continuously.  The  exposure  ran  4  hrs/day  for  5  days.
After  the  exposure  the  hearing  loss  in  the  impact  group  was  20  –  40  dB  greater
that  the  continuous  noise.  (The  RMS  values  of  both  noises  were  equivalent  at
110dB SPL (re: 20uPa) integrated over a 32 second window.)65

If there is an equivalence between chinchilla hearing and marine mammal hearing,
this  would  indicate that  acceptable  exposure  levels  for  repetitive  signals  (such  as
seismic  airgun  surveys)  need  to  be  set  significantly  lower  than  mitigation  levels
derived from static thresholds (e.g.: behavioral or TTS thresholds).

Continuous  noise  is  most  commonly  considered  in  terms  of  masking  important
biological  signals  66  and  intermediate  and  long  term  physiological  stress.67
Heretofore  the  dominant  source  of  continuous  anthropogenic  ocean  noise  under
consideration  has  been  omnipresent  and  increasing  shipping  noise.68  While
shipping  noise  has  increased  10  –  15  dB  over  the  past  50  years  due  to
globalization and increase in vessel size, the increase of ocean ambient noise due
to shipping may be leveling off; an unlikely doubling of the merchant fleet (~95,000
boats certified by Lloyds Register) would increase sound pressure level by 6dB (re:
1uPa2).

On the other hand, there are many growing sources of ocean ambient noise driven
by the increasing global demand for energy, coupled with advances in technology
that allow deepwater development ever further out onto the outer continental shelf.
Some of these sources include:

•  Off-shore  Liquid  Natural  Gas

facilities  with  processing,  regasifying,

compressing, cooling and shipping.

•  Deepwater oil extraction and drilling platforms
•  Sea bottom petrochemical processing such as “process fluids” injectors and

separators.

•  Deepwater minerals extraction.
•  Fleets  of  acoustically  controlled  Autonomous  Underwater  Vessels  (AUV’s)

to tend to all of the above.

Currently  there  are  few  noise  regulations  or  guidelines  on  any  of  these
technologies. They are developing in most coastal waters world-wide. While each
source will have a distinct sound or set of sounds – from single events, to rhythmic,
to  continuous,  intersecting  the  various  frequency  bands  form  low  to  mid  to  high,

Page 16

with various signals characteristics – from broad band to frequency specific to high
kurtosis, the overall effect will increase the broadband ambient noise in the ocean.

Page 17

4.0 Recommendations

When  crafting  mitigation  guidelines  for  anthropogenic  noise,  the  subject  noise
should  be evaluated  in  terms  of  the  many ways  in  which  it  may  induce  biological
responses, including stress, masking communication and environmental cues, and
inducing  avoidance  and  other  phonotaxic  behavior.  Current  noise  pollution
mitigation  schemes,  which  tend  to  focus  on  amplitude  alone,  are  not  sufficient  to
prevent harmful impacts to whales.

Signal  exposure  mitigation  should  be  evaluated  in  terms  of  the  following
characteristics:

Amplitude:   In  terms  of  how  the  noise  approaches  or  exceeds  the  amplitude  of

naturally occurring sounds.

Frequency:  In terms of how the noise intersects the perceptual pass band of the

subject animal.

Form:

In terms of whether the sound has a biological equivalence; if so, will
the  sound  confuse  the  animal,  if  not  will  the  sound  harass  or
endanger the animal

In terms of sound forms that are alien to the natural environment by
way  of  fast  rise  time,  high  kurtosis,  high  crest  factor,  impulse
response, and envelope.

Periodicity:  In  terms  of  whether  the  sound  interferes  with  the  animals  biological

temporal cues

In terms of how the noise masks biological cues and obscures critical
communication bands.

40 A few insects are known to sense and respond to pitch, otherwise only mammals seem to respond to pitch-
specific  cues.  See:  Gabriella  Gibson  and  Ian  Russell  “Flying  in  Tune:  Sexual  Recognition  in  Mosquitoes”
2006 Current Biology v.16(13) pp 1311-1316. In this study mosquitoes of the opposite sex will tailor their
wing beat frequency until their flight tones match. Otherwise only mammals seem to respond to pitch-specific
cues.
41 An “octave” is a doubling of frequency e.g. 20Hz, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, 5120, 10240, 20480
Hz represents the ~9 octave pass-band of humans.
