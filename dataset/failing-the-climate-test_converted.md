ESSENTIAL CONTEXT AND KEY FINDINGS

In December 2024, the Biden Administration’s Department
of Energy (DOE) issued a study of the socio-economic and
environmental impacts of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG)
exports. One volume of the study demonstrates how to
estimate the increase in global greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions caused by U.S. LNG exports from individual
terminals using company-specific data.

The DOE has a strong precedent of considering the GHG
emissions impact of LNG terminals as part of its public
interest determination required by the Natural Gas Act. While
previous studies have assumed without justification that
U.S. LNG exports substitute 1-for-1 with other fossil fuels,
the new study uses the Global Change Assessment Model,
a well-established tool, to estimate the market and energy
displacement effects of increasing U.S. exports. Thus, the
new study describes a more holistic approach that is better
suited to assessing the climate impacts of U.S. LNG exports in
a world with soaring rates of renewable energy adoption and
important, albeit uncertain, climate policy influences.

The new methodology implies a “climate test” as it shows
how much companies would need to reduce production-
through-liquefaction GHG emissions, relative to the sector
average, to be considered “climate neutral.” We apply this
methodology to a selection of planned projects and assess
the scenarios and assumptions used.

	| Applying the DOE’s methodology to five planned LNG
projects—Venture Global CP2, Cameron LNG Phase II,
Sabine Pass Stage V, Cheniere Corpus Christi LNG Midscale
8-9, and Freeport LNG Expansion—indicates that each
of them would result in a net increase in global GHG
emissions regardless of the climate policy, energy demand,
and technology assumptions underlying the calculation.
In practical terms, all five LNG projects appear to fail a
climate test that the DOE put forward to ensure approvals
are consistent with the public interest.

	| Sustainability measures cannot make increasing LNG exports
consistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC. Even if major steps
were taken to reduce the GHG emissions associated with LNG
production through liquefaction—such as gas supply basin
switching, LNG terminal methane abatement, and powering
liquefaction with renewable electricity—increasing LNG
exports from the Gulf Coast would still lead to global GHG
emissions increases above the level consistent with the DOE’s
most stringent climate mitigation scenario.

	| Under a scenario with safer and more realistic constraints
on the availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS), the
climate impact of increasing LNG exports would be even

greater because deeper reductions in fossil fuel production
would be necessary. The DOE’s most conservative CCS
assumption under a Net Zero scenario surpasses feasible
scale-up rates based on historical technology analogues and
results in gas sector CCS volumes five times higher than in
the International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions scenario.

	| While the methodology presented in the 2024 LNG Study
is a major improvement upon previous federal analyses,
it still fails to sufficiently account for emissions from large,
accidental releases (such as “super-emitter” events),
equipment malfunction, and malpractice. High rates of
methane emissions during the ocean transport stage of the
LNG supply chain are also not represented. Incorporating
measurement-based data and more realistic assumptions
would make clearer the immense climate impact of building
new LNG infrastructure, especially in the near-term.

Key recommendations
	| The U.S. Department of Energy should use the “climate

test” to reject pending and future LNG export applications.
Further, the Department of Energy should use its authority
under the Natural Gas Act to reevaluate the public interest
status of LNG projects that received authorizations without
consideration of climate impacts or under analyses that
predate the 2024 LNG Study.

	| Congress should pass legislation that makes it a statutory

requirement under the Natural Gas Act to assess the climate
impact of gas exports and reject applications that would
increase global GHG emissions under a credible scenario to
limit warming to 1.5ºC. Additionally, U.S. federal agencies
should require all new proposed fossil fuel production and
infrastructure projects to meet a similarly high standard
under the National Environmental Policy Act.

	| Energy purchasers, financial institutions, and foreign

governments should refrain from entering into long-term
offtake agreements for U.S. LNG and financing of LNG
infrastructure. Instead, these parties should prioritize
measures that accelerate the renewable energy transition
and plan for a managed phase-out of fossil fuels. Group
of Seven nations, in particular, should abide by their
2022 commitment to stop financing overseas fossil fuel
infrastructure with taxpayer money.

	| Where it is not possible to entirely phase out gas imports,

foreign parties should insist upon transparent, independent,
and representative measurement-based evidence to
substantiate U.S.-based claims of methane abatement
(e.g., under the European Union Methane Regulation).

KEY RECOMMENDATIONSBACKGROUND

In December 2024, the Biden Administration’s Department of Energy (DOE) published a long-
awaited update to the agency’s analysis of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The multi-volume
analysis, termed the 2024 LNG Export Study, represents the most comprehensive government
assessment to-date of the energy, economic, and environmental impacts of U.S. LNG exports.

The official notice of availability of the study explains
that its purpose is “to inform [DOE’s] public interest
review of, and ultimately decisions in, certain
applications to export LNG to countries with which the
United States does not have a free trade agreement
(FTA) [...]”1 In other words, the study should hold
relevance to the U.S. federal government’s decisions
whether to issue key authorizations to major LNG
projects, including both expansion projects like
Cheniere Sabine Pass Stage V and new terminals like
Venture Global CP2.

Among other determinations, the study found that
unconstrained LNG exports would increase U.S.
household and wholesale domestic energy costs, that
communities near LNG facilities are overburdened with
pollution, and that very large LNG projects yield higher
direct lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than many
of the world’s countries.2 As explained in a statement
by Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, the study
“reinforces that a business-as-usual approach is neither
sustainable nor advisable.”3

Introduction to the “climate test”
Perhaps nowhere is it clearer in the study how the
authors intend for it to be applied than in its treatment
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: the study proposes
a step-by-step analysis that can be applied at the project
level to estimate how pending and future applications
to export LNG could impact global emissions levels.4
Further, the study provides “breakeven rates,” which
indicate the emissions performance that an individual
project would need to achieve to be considered
effectively climate neutral based on assumptions like
market substitution. No other topic addressed by the
study is granted this kind of project specificity.

In this report, we apply DOE’s project-specific analysis
to five major LNG projects that are pending final
authorization: Venture Global CP2, Cameron LNG
Phase II, Sabine Pass Stage V, Cheniere Corpus Christi
LNG Midscale 8-9, and Freeport LNG Expansion.5
Framing the analysis as a pass or fail “climate test,” our
findings make clear that none of the projects would
pass muster—even with highly optimistic assumptions
of facility-level flaring efficiency, upstream methane
leakage rates, and downstream carbon capture and
sequestration (CCS) availability. This fills a gap in
the DOE’s 2024 LNG Study, which demonstrates how
the methodology can be used to assess hypothetical
projects and presents liquefaction stage GHG emissions
data for actual LNG projects that were operating in 2020,
but does not carry out a full analysis of operating or
proposed projects.

Salience of the analysis in a post-Trump 2.0 world
It is not lost on us that the second election of Donald
J. Trump complicates what might otherwise have
been a near-term shift in U.S. LNG export policy.
President Trump’s support for fossil fuels is expected
to bring “positivity to the energy industry,”6 and
the administration has signaled that it will issue
authorization decisions “as expeditiously as possible.”7
Yet, this does not guarantee the projects will succeed.8

LNG terminals depend on public and private financial
backing, insurance, and purchase contracts, as well as
authorizations issued by the U.S. government. The titanic
scale of LNG terminals means they take years to build and
decades to pay off. Notably, there are indications that the
LNG industry is overprojecting long-term demand.9

What makes the climate test of the 2024 LNG Study
particularly relevant is that future U.S. administrations
could potentially use it to rescind LNG export applications
that were rubber stamped under Trump based on more

evidence-based findings of climate impact.10 Further,
many public and private LNG backers and purchasers
have their own climate pledges, targets, and policies,
which require consideration of climate impacts in their
own right. Notable public examples include the Group
of Seven (G7) pledge to end public finance for overseas
“unabated” fossil fuel development, except for in “limited
circumstances … consistent with a 1.5 °C warming
limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement,”11, 12 and
the European Union (EU) Methane Regulation,13 which
requires that fossil fuel imports to the EU, as well as fossil
fuel companies operating in the EU, meet emissions
disclosure and methane abatement standards. Many
private sector LNG backers possess climate commitments
but have demonstrated a weak commitment to phasing
out fossil fuels.14, 15 Still, these parties should strongly
consider the climate, environmental and social impacts;
regulatory uncertainty; and stranded asset risk of
investing in new LNG projects.

BACKGROUNDEXPLANATION OF DOE’S
PROJECT-LEVEL GHG ANALYSIS

The concept underpinning DOE’s proposed GHG analysis is that of “consequential emissions”:
the change in global GHG emissions that is modeled to occur as a result of introducing
incremental U.S. LNG volumes to the market. It can be understood as the difference between
estimates of global GHG emissions with and without the volume of LNG under study, assuming
that energy markets respond to changes in energy supply in certain ways (e.g., substituting for
U.S. LNG with alternative energy sources and/or reduced energy demand).

Although the method proposed by DOE appears to
be novel, the concept of substitution in global energy
markets is not.16 In fact, since 2014 every final LNG export
authorization order issued by DOE has cited studies of
LNG insisting that the “net” emissions impact of LNG is
negative by comparison to an energy-equivalent volume
of coal or foreign gas (Figure S1). Other U.S. federal
agencies have also commonly used fuel displacement
analyses to assess the GHG impact of projects under the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).17

What is novel about the method proposed by the 2024
LNG Export Study is that it uses scenarios modeled
with the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to
assess the fuel displacement effects of exporting U.S.
LNG, instead of assuming without justification that U.S.
LNG substitutes 1-for-1 for other fossil fuels. While a full
explanation of the newly proposed method is beyond
the scope of this report, a high-level characterization of
DOE’s modeling approach and method for determining
consequential emissions are provided below.

Modeling approach
In Appendix A of the 2024 LNG Study, the GCAM model
is used to assess the global energy and emissions
implications of increased U.S. LNG export levels under
different assumptions, which characterize global climate
policies and technology availability (Table 1).

Scenario design
Three global climate policies assumptions are
represented: Defined Policies, which explicitly
represents key provisions of U.S. climate policies
and elsewhere in the world constrains CO2 emissions
to levels consistent with policies;18 Commitments,
which assumes all countries achieve their pledges
under the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework on Climate Change; and Net Zero
2050, which assumes the world achieves net-zero CO2
emissions by 2050. The global mean warming (50%
likelihood) associated with the assumptions are 2.7ºC,
1.6ºC, and 1.4ºC, respectively.

Two technology availability assumptions are represented:
High CCS, which uses GCAM’s default assumptions about
CCS and carbon management alternatives; and Moderate
CCS, which uses cost assumptions that favor wind,
solar, and grid battery technologies over CCS, as well
as capping global CCS levels so they do not exceed 8.7
GtCO2 by 2050 and capping global bioenergy levels to 100
EJ annually. These technology availability assumptions
are combined only with the Commitments and Net Zero
2050 scenarios. We note that while the Net Zero (Moderate
CCS) scenarios are the most stringent scenarios included
in the 2024 LNG Study, they still depend on CCS levels
that we—and many other civil society organizations—
consider problematic to accommodate the continued use
of fossil fuels.19 Specifically, they contain roughly 13–14 EJ
of gas consumption equipped with CCS in 2030 and 86–91
EJ in 2050—volumes up to five times higher than the IEA’s
Net-Zero by 2050 scenario. These CCS assumptions are
likely not feasible: research has shown that the IEA Net-

FAIL ING  THE “CLIMATE  TE ST”  |  7

Zero scenario itself assumes an amount of CCS across all
sectors in 2030 that is four times higher than the upper
bound of “feasible deployment” based on historical
analogue technology deployment pathways.20

for maximizing the usage of U.S. LNG export capacity,
even when it is not cost-effective under default Model
Resolved assumptions, or higher demand specifically for
U.S. LNG in foreign markets.

For each set of assumptions, DOE models three
scenarios with different levels of U.S. LNG exports:
Existing/FID Exports, which constrains export levels to
the capacity of LNG projects that are currently operating
or planned with a final investment decision (FID); Model
Resolved, which uses GCAM to determine economically
driven levels of U.S. LNG exports; and High Exports,
which lowers the cost of U.S. LNG such that export levels
are forced above the Model Resolved level by a certain
amount in five year increments. Qualitatively, the High
Exports scenarios approximate strong political support

Sensitivity cases that explore the economic
competitiveness of U.S. gas in the global gas market
are also executed (not shown by Table 1). These cases
are characterized by High U.S. Supply, which makes
U.S. gas more cost-competitive, Low U.S. Supply, which
makes U.S. gas less cost-competitive, and High Middle
East Supply, which makes gas from the Middle East
region more cost-competitive.21 By combining these
assumptions with the Defined Policies: Model Resolved
and Defined Policies: Existing/FID Exports scenarios,
respectively, DOE obtains six sensitivity cases.

Emissions impact of U.S. LNG exports
Equation 1 shows how the average consequential GHG
intensity of U.S. exports is estimated for a given Model
Resolved or High Exports scenario compared to the
corresponding Existing/FID scenario.22 There are a total
of 12 scenario n options, including sensitivity cases, that
are valid inputs to Equation 1.23

A negative result would indicate U.S. LNG exports reduce
global emissions, as might be expected if GCAM finds that
LNG primarily displaces higher emissions fuel sources,
while a positive result would suggest the opposite.

EXPLANATION OF DOE’S PROJECT-LEVEL GHG ANALYSIS

Method characterization
For a given project, the consequential GHG intensity
is determined by the sum of two terms, as shown by
Equation 2.25 The first term, project direct emissions
intensity, is calculated at the project level. The second
term, project non-direct emissions intensity, is a
scenario-dependent variable that is calculated by
DOE independently of the LNG project. (We adopt the
convention used in the 2024 LNG Study of referring to
these terms in shorthand as simply project direct emissions
and project non-direct emissions in most places.)

 Consequential GHG Intensity of US Exports scenario n, project p

= Project Direct Emissions project p +
Project Non-Direct Emissions scenario n (2)

where:

Project direct emissions include liquefaction
emissions and all upstream emissions of
producing and processing the natural gas before
liquefaction, and;

Project non-direct emissions include emissions
not included in the definition of emissions. This
includes direct emissions from ocean shipping,
regasification, importing country transport of
the gas, and use (unspecified) of the export gas,
plus the direct and indirect market effects. For
many scenarios the term is negative, owing to
fossil fuel displacement.

If the two terms balance out, the consequential GHG
intensity associated with the project under evaluation is
estimated to be zero.

Derivation of the project non-direct
emissions term
Project non-direct emissions are calculated by
subtracting the average project direct emissions from
the consequential GHG intensity of U.S. exports for a
given scenario, as shown by Equation 3.26 Project non-
direct emissions are negative for scenarios where the
consequential GHG intensity of LNG exports modeled by
GCAM is smaller than the average project direct emissions.
The DOE’s explanation of project non-direct emissions
specifies that it is an “interim value [...] and should not be
used as the basis for interpreting study findings.”27

Project Non-Direct Emissions scenario n

= Consequential GHG Intensity of US Exports scenario n
– Project Direct Emissions average (3)

where:

Consequential GHG intensity of US exports is the
result of Equation 1, and;

Average project direct emissions are estimated
by DOE using a combination of self-reported
data and bottom-up modeling. For the upstream
through transmissions segment, DOE uses the
U.S. average GHG intensity of domestic natural
gas (production through transmission), as
determined by the DOE/NETL Life Cycle Analysis
of Natural Gas Extraction and Power Generation:
U.S. 2020 Emissions Profile study, published
in 2024 (2024 LCA Study).28, 29 For liquefaction
stage emissions, DOE uses U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas
Reporting Program (GHGRP) data for the year
2020 and gap-filling adjustments to estimate the
production weighted average liquefaction stage
GHG intensity of six LNG terminals.30 The result
obtained by DOE, 14.5 g CO2e/MJ of exported
LNG (low heating value [LHV] basis), is held
constant across all scenarios.

EXPLANATION OF DOE’S PROJECT-LEVEL GHG ANALYSIS

Project-level inputs
At the project level, estimates of the emissions intensity
of LNG from gas production through liquefaction are
summed to determine the project direct emissions
term of Equation 2. The calculation of this term can be
divided into three steps:

1.  Estimate production through transmissions GHG

emissions (i.e., GHG emissions up to the terminal gate);

2.  Estimate liquefaction stage emissions (gate to gate);

3.  Align emissions to a common functional unit and take

the sum.

The final step produces the estimated project direct
emissions term that is added to project non-direct
emissions in Equation 2 to calculate the project-level
consequential GHG intensity of LNG exports.

Determination of breakeven rates
DOE also uses a comparison of the average project
direct emissions and project non-direct emissions
terms under each scenario to calculate “breakeven
rates,” or “the percent change difference between an
individual project’s emissions intensity and the default
assumptions that would result in consequential GHG
intensity of zero for the project” (Equation 4).

  – (Project Non-Direct Emissionsscenario n)

For example, the Defined Policies: Model Resolved
scenario has a breakeven rate of -43%, which is the
percent change from 14.5 g CO2e/MJ, the average
project direct emissions, to 8.2 g CO2e/MJ, the project
direct emissions level that would result in zero
consequential emissions under the Defined Policies:

intensity term to zero in equation 3, noting that -8.2 g
CO2e/MJ is the project non-direct emissions value for
Defined Policies: Model Resolved.)

In the subsequent section of this report, we first
calculate the project-level inputs to DOE’s consequential
emissions analysis for five LNG projects. We then
compare the project direct emissions of each LNG
terminal to the breakeven rates associated with all 12
scenarios. Finally, we examine the consequential GHG
intensity of each project based on the Defined Policies:
Model Resolved scenario—the dominant scenario used
in the 2024 LNG Study—and the Net Zero (Moderate
CCS): High U.S. Exports scenario—the scenario with the
deepest emissions reductions and least reliance on CCS
and biofuels in the 2024 LNG Study.

EXPLANATION OF DOE’S PROJECT-LEVEL GHG ANALYSISAPPLYING THE CLIMATE TEST TO FIVE
PROPOSED LNG PROJECTS

Using the methodology laid out in the 2024 LNG Study, we assess five proposed LNG projects
that are currently not authorized to export LNG to non-FTA countries and do not have an FID.31
The annual emissions associated with these projects cannot be determined with certainty, in
part because the projects are as-of-yet unbuilt. Therefore, we assume that the GHG intensity of
these projects is well-represented by existing LNG terminals, as shown by Table 2.

For all the terminals except Venture Global Calcasieu
Pass, we use data from the reporting year 2020 to align
with the calculations used in the 2024 LNG Study. For
Calcasieu Pass, which exported its first LNG cargo in
March 2022, we use data from the reporting year 2023.

The 2024 LNG Study expresses combined GHG emissions
using IPCC AR6 100-year global warming potential (GWP)
values by “default” and 20-year GWP values where
otherwise noted.32 Our results are expressed using only
100-year GWP values. We note that in the 2024 LNG
Study, using 20-year values increases the average project
direct emissions of U.S. exports but tends to reduce
the difficulty of the climate test. This is because using a
100-year value emphasizes the effect of U.S. LNG exports
driving up net fossil fuel demand, which is very difficult

to offset through methane abatement, whereas using
a 20-year value emphasizes the mitigation potential
associated with methane reductions. Using a 20-year
value also amplifies flaws in the DOE methodology,
which disproportionately underestimates methane
emissions by failing to sufficiently account for large,
accidental releases, equipment malfunction, malpractice,
and methane slippage across various stages of the LNG
supply chain (as explained in Section 5. Weaknesses of
the 2024 LNG Study emissions calculation).

In this section, we use the names of the proxy terminals
in all figures and tables. We emphasize, however,
that the emissions results should be considered
representative of the five proposed LNG projects that
are awaiting final non-FTA export authorization and FID.

Step 1: Estimate production-through-transmission GHG emissions

We obtained gas supply sourcing estimates by LNG
terminal from RBN Energy, a well-reputed energy
markets analytic firm that operates a proprietary
model of methane gas production, demand, and
flows.33 We obtained estimates of production-through-
transmission GHG intensity by gas production scenario
and gas delivery region pair from the 2024 LCA Study.
In the 2024 LCA Study, each gas production scenario
represents gas production from a given basin using a
given extraction technology.

Using a crosswalk (Table S1), we mapped the gas supply
source regions used by RBN to the gas production
scenarios used by DOE and calculated the weighted
average GHG intensity by gas supply source and delivery
region pair, and the weighted average GHG intensity by
delivery region overall. Further, we used the crosswalked
2024 LCA Study data and the LNG terminal sourcing
estimates from RBN to calculate the weighted average
GHG intensity by LNG terminal. These data are expressed
with a functional unit of 1 MJ of gas, high heating value
(HHV) basis, delivered to the LNG terminal gate in Figure 1.

APPLYING THE CLIMATE TEST TO FIVE PROPOSED LNG PROJECTSStep 2: Estimate liquefaction stage emissions

We obtained liquefaction stage GHG emissions intensity
values for Cheniere Corpus Christi, Freeport LNG,
Cameron LNG, and Sabine Pass from the 2024 LNG
Study. DOE based these values on company-reported
data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), 2020
reporting year. To account for “known data gaps with
regards to natural gas liquefaction facilities, including
not accounting for GHG emissions from acid gas
removal units (AGRU) and electricity consumption
for compressors,” and “minor differences in the
combustion factors used in the calculation of emissions
from GHGRP Subpart C data and those used by NETL
in its LNG modeling,” DOE applied several adjustments
to the company-reported data. DOE also converted the
GHGRP emissions data from AR4, 100-year values to
AR6, 100-year values.

Notably, DOE did not incorporate reported emissions
data from the Freeport LNG Pretreatment facility into
its analysis. By our assessment, using these data would
have increased Freeport LNG’s liquefaction stage GHG
emissions by around 630,000 t CO2e.34

For Venture Global Calcasieu Pass, which was not
included in the 2024 LNG Study because it did not export
its first cargo until March 2022, we estimate liquefaction
stage GHG emissions using the approach laid out in the
2024 LNG study based on company-reported emissions
data from the EPA GHGRP, 2023 reporting year (for
calculation details, see Section S1).

Estimated liquefaction stage emissions are shown in
Table 3 and expressed with three different functional
units: 1 kg of LNG exported, 1 MJ of LNG exported
(HHV), and 1 MJ of LNG exported (lower heating value
[LHV] basis).

APPLYING THE CLIMATE TEST TO FIVE PROPOSED LNG PROJECTSStep 3: Align emissions to common functional unit

To calculate the total project direct emissions per LNG
terminal, the GHG intensity values from Figure 1 and
Table 3 need to be converted to the same functional
unit and summed. To match the 2024 LNG Study, we use
1 MJ of LNG exported on a lower heating value (LHV)
basis as the final unit35 and assume that around 1.07 kg
of methane gas are delivered to the liquefaction plant
per 1 kg of gas throughput from the plant.36

For each LNG terminal, Table 4 shows the aligned
production-through-transmission and liquefaction
stage results, the sum total project direct emissions, and
the percent change difference between the individual
terminal’s GHG intensity and the average project direct
emissions value, 14.5 g CO2e/MJ, determined by the
2024 LNG Study.37

Step 4: Compare to benchmarks and
estimate consequential GHG intensity

The percent change difference between each LNG
terminal’s GHG intensity and the default value can be
directly compared to breakeven rates to assess whether
exports from the terminal would result in a consequential
GHG intensity above or below zero. Figure 2 illustrates
this comparison for all LNG terminals in our analysis.

In Figure 2, the height of each bar represents the GHG
intensity of the respective terminal expressed as percent
change from the default value. In order to have a
consequential intensity of zero or lower relative to a given
scenario, the bar representing a terminal must cross the
dashed line representing the given scenario’s breakeven
rate (ranging from -8% to -87%). This condition is not met
for any of the terminals under any scenario.

All assessed LNG projects fail the climate test

All five LNG terminals we assess using the DOE’s
methodology fail to achieve a GHG intensity equivalent
to or lower than the breakeven rates presented in the
2024 LNG Study. In equivalent terms, there are no
scenarios assessed by the DOE under which increasing
LNG exports from these terminals (or similar terminals)
would result in climate benefits. We surmise that if the
DOE were to apply a “climate test” to the five proposed
projects named in Table 2, consistent with the 2024 LNG
study, all five of the projects would fail.

This conclusion holds true regardless of whether the
LNG projects are evaluated against scenarios that
accelerate climate change mitigation or not. Likewise, it
holds true even for the DOE’s High CCS scenarios, under
which CCS deployment is unconstrained. Further, the
climate impact of U.S. exports is shown to be higher
when U.S. export levels are buoyed by political support,

as in the High Exports scenarios, rather than driven by
default economic assumptions, as in the Model Resolved
scenarios.

Although the Moderate CCS scenarios do not sufficiently
limit CCS dependence to resolve our concerns
about feasibility, mitigation deterrence, and social/
environmental sustainability, they show that the
climate impact of U.S. exports is much greater when
CCS levels are reduced. Under a scenario with safer and
more realistic constraints on the availability of CCS, the
climate impact of U.S. exports would be even greater
because deeper reductions in fossil fuel production
would be necessary. Still, in the absence of a more
ambitious alternative, we use the Net Zero (Moderate
CCS) scenario as a reference for the next section of this
report and recommend for policymakers to likewise
use this scenario as a default reference with an
understanding of its limitations.

APPLYING THE CLIMATE TEST TO FIVE PROPOSED LNG PROJECTSCLEANER PRODUCTION CANNOT
MAKE LNG 1.5ºC ALIGNED

Even if major steps were taken to reduce the GHG emissions associated with LNG production
through liquefaction, LNG projects along the Gulf Coast would continue to fail the breakeven
analysis under the Net Zero (Moderate CCS) scenario.

Figure 3 shows how the production weighted average
GHG intensity of U.S. exports from the five LNG terminals
under study would change as a result of the following
four measures:

1.  Optimizing gas supply. LNG operators purchase gas

from only the lowest GHG intensity supply source region
(Southwest Texas for the Southwest delivery region and
Northeast Louisiana for the Southeast delivery region);

2. Minimizing liquefaction stage CH4. LNG

operators eliminate all liquefaction stage methane

emissions associated with flaring inefficiencies,
equipment leaks, and blowdown methane emissions;

3. Using all-electric drivers. LNG operators use all-
electric drivers to power liquefaction, substituting
grid-factor power generation for gas combustion at
the terminal;

4. Powering with renewable energy. LNG operators use
high-integrity renewable energy (i.e., 24/7 time matching
and additionality criteria met) to power liquefaction.

For calculation details and a full explanation of the
analysis, see Section S3.

Figure 3. Key mitigation steps do not close the gap between average LNG project GHG intensity and
breakeven rate. Dark green bar shows weighted average project direct GHG emissions based on analysis
in this report. Blue bars show weighted average reduction potential from four key mitigation steps. Light
green bar shows weighted average project direct GHG emissions if all mitigation steps are implemented.
Horizontal line shows the breakeven rate associated with NZ (Mod CCS): High Exports v. Existing/FID.

FAIL ING  THE “CLIMATE TE ST”  |  19

At a maximum, these measures could change the
GHG intensity of U.S. exports by -48% compared to
the default value estimated by the DOE; however, the
breakeven rate for the Net Zero (Moderate CCS) scenario
is -87%. The magnitude of this difference, even after
all mitigation steps have been taken, suggests that no
realistic mitigation can make U.S. LNG exports aligned
with limiting warming to 1.5ºC. This reflects that while
emissions performance both upstream of the LNG facility
and at the facility itself are important, the net increase in
global GHG emissions caused by increasing LNG exports
is primarily due to the manner in which they displace
renewable energy and drive up overall energy demand.

There are caveats to this optimization analysis, which
reflect both limitations in the data and questions about
the effectiveness of corporate sustainability practices
at generating real-world emissions reductions and
avoiding adverse impacts. First, methane emissions
are likely underestimated in both the baseline and

emissions savings estimates due to DOE’s reliance
on bottom-up and company-reported data. Second,
because U.S. gas travels through a network with limited
physical traceability, there is a risk that gas purchased
by LNG companies to mitigate emissions would reflect
the trade of virtual attributes without impacting the
broader mix of gas production. Similarly, it is well-
known that some renewable energy procurement
strategies are unlikely to increase the amount of
renewable energy on grids.38 Third, we note that
electrifying liquefaction processes without building
out an attendant supply of renewable energy would
likely increase the use of dispatchable fossil fuel power
sources on the grid and increase costs for other energy
users. Fourth, a consideration of climate justice suggests
that renewable energy must be viewed as a valuable
public good to be used wisely and that positioning
renewable energy as a tool to continue fossil fuel
extraction in the global North is highly problematic.39

CLEANER PRODUCTION CANNOT MAKE LNG 1.5ºC ALIGNEDWEAKNESSES OF THE 2024 LNG STUDY
EMISSIONS CALCULATION

The 2024 LNG Study uses GCAM, a well-established model, to examine the impacts of increased
LNG exports on global energy balances and emissions, which substantially improves the agency’s
assessment of the life cycle emissions of U.S. LNG exports by accounting for how LNG interacts
with energy demand in destination markets. However, significant shortcomings remain in the
DOE’s approach, which suggest underestimation of the GHG emissions impact of U.S. exports.

malfunction, and accidental releases. In particular,
bottom-up estimates fail to capture the effect of large, so-
called “super-emitter,” events.45, 46, 47

Systematic underestimations and optimistic assumptions
Many peer-reviewed studies indicate gas sector
production-through-transmission emissions are higher
than DOE’s assumption of a 0.56% methane emissions
rate—a rate which could underestimate such emissions
by a factor of four or more (Table S2). It is more
challenging to assess liquefaction stage emissions due to
the potential for companies to under-report emissions,
wide range of flaring efficiency rates in the scientific
literature, high temporal variability, and shortage of
independent measurements. DOE’s proposed approach
does not sufficiently mitigate these factors and results in
an average estimated liquefaction stage methane rate on
the lower side of published research—0.316 g CH4/kg LNG
(0.00645 g CH4/MJ LNG, LHV).40 This matters because it
is logical to assume that if the emissions from producing
and liquefying LNG are greater, the consequential
emissions of LNG exports are also greater.41

Similarly, DOE relies on company-reported liquefaction
emissions, which are extremely variable and seemingly
implausible to validate without frequent, independent
measurements. For example, a 2021 Clean Air Task Force
report found the largest source of methane emissions from
LNG import, export, and storage “appears to be irregular
venting from blowdowns, which represents over 80% of
emissions in estimates.”48 Yet, DOE’s analysis assumes
emissions from a single year are representative of the
average, but this is not the case due to huge year-to-year
fluctuations in reported blowdown methane emissions.
For example, total blowdown methane emissions reported
in 2020 were <5% of blowdown methane emissions
reported by Freeport LNG alone in 2016.49, 50

Two recent peer-reviewed, large-scale, aerial
measurement-based studies indicate leakage rates
ranging from 2-2.95% of gross oil and gas production.42, 43
Likewise, DOE’s basin-level methane intensity estimates
are very low compared to measurement-based estimates.
For example, measurement-based estimates assessed
by DOE are roughly 2 to 7 times higher for the Permian
basin and 3 to 4 times higher for the Anadarko basin.44
One major reason for DOE’s low emissions estimate
is its “bottom-up” methodology, primarily based on
company data self-reported to the EPA. This approach
assumes equipment is operated and performs according
to theoretical or manufacturer’s specifications and has
been criticized for failing to account for malpractice,

DOE estimates flaring-related emissions based on
company-reported flare gas volumes and an assumed
98% efficiency rate. However, a peer-reviewed study
published in 2023 found flare efficiency rates were
highly variable and contingent on operating conditions:
four of six flares assessed under normal conditions
had efficiency rates lower than 98%, two of which were
lower than 60%.51 A 2015 literature review of liquefaction
terminal methane intensity found a range spanning 0.01
to 4.22 g CO2e/MJ HHV.52 DOE’s study does not reference
these academic sources, yet includes favorable
comparisons to two studies funded by Cheniere and
partially conducted by Cheniere engineers.53, 54

FAIL ING  THE “CLIMATE TE ST”  |  21

Characterization of Permian gas

The DOE may drastically overestimate the proportion
of Permian gas that is extracted with “conventional”
technology, which is treated as having lower emissions
than shale gas extracted with fracking and horizontal
drilling.55 Whereas the 2024 LCA Study, on which the
DOE study bases its estimates of upstream methane
emissions, indicates that 58% of Permian gas production
was conventional in 2020,56 Rystad Energy Ucube data
categorizes just 7% of Permian gas production in 2020
as conventional (Figure 4).57 Rystad services are widely
used by oil and gas industry professionals and track
production from over 60,000 assets globally.

Rystad data further show that the proportion of
conventional production in the Permian Basin is
decreasing: conventional production fell to 4% of total
gas production in 2024 and is projected to be just 2% by
2030 (Figure 4).

The DOE’s Energy Information Administration provides
figures that also contrast with NETL’s assessment. A
comparison of its data on “Dry Shale Gas Production”
for the Permian Basin compared with total gas
production in the basin from its “Drilling Productivity
Report” suggests that shale production, which is
generally considered unconventional, accounted for
66% of total gas production in the basin in 2020.58, 59

There is evidence that the Permian basin has very high
methane leakage rates. One study found rates as high as
9.4% of gas production in the New Mexico portion of the
basin,60 with other studies finding leakage rates across
the basin around 3.7%.61

WEAKNESSES OF THE 2024 LNG STUDY EMISSIONS CALCULATIONCoarse representation of ocean transport

Because GCAM does not appear to differentiate between
ocean vessel types, the 2024 LNG Study likely fails to
capture the distinct—and potentially higher—GHG
emissions profile of LNG carriers.62 These ships use
“boil-off” gas from LNG cargo tanks as their primary
fuel, which, while generating lower CO2 emissions
than conventional marine fuels, has been found to
result in significant methane slip from their engines.63,
64 Consequently, the DOE likely underestimates the
potent near-term warming effect of U.S. LNG exports
when using a 20-year GWP to calculate the average
consequential GHG intensity of exports.65 It is harder to

judge whether GCAM overestimates or underestimates
emissions from the ocean transport stage of the LNG
supply chain using a 100-year GWP. We emphasize,
however, that the long-term climate impact of LNG
exports remains a high concern. Further, the degree
to which ocean transport emissions influence the
consequential GHG intensity of U.S. exports is likely
higher under more stringent climate scenarios, where
LNG exports displace renewable energy, than under
scenarios where U.S. exports compete with fossil fuels
that may also require long-distance ocean transport.

More realistic assumptions of emissions would make clearer
the immense climate impact of additional LNG exports

The modeling of consequential emissions from
increasing LNG exports finds that net emissions
increase as a result of greater LNG exports due to the
displacement of cleaner energy sources and increases
in gas consumption. This effect is greater in scenarios
where reductions in fossil fuel consumption and
emissions constrain climate change. The large body
of evidence cited above demonstrates that upstream
emissions from U.S. gas production are likely higher
than those used in the DOE’s study and a small but
growing body of evidence suggests midstream methane
emissions are also higher, which indicates that the
likely impact of increasing LNG exports is greater than
the DOE study and our analysis find.66 As the current
administration deregulates the oil and gas sector,
eliminating the methane rule passed in the Inflation
Reduction Act67 and reducing the EPA’s ability to
record and track data on oil and gas equipment and

emissions,68 there is a significant chance that emissions
from the U.S. oil and gas sector, including those
associated with LNG supply and production will rise.

Ultimately, this analysis underscores that there is no
way to make LNG compatible with staving off grave and
potentially irreversible levels of global warming. To the
contrary, DOE’s scenario exercise shows that pathways
aligned with limiting warming to 1.5ºC involve reducing
LNG exports below the level that is possible given
projects that are already operating or have FID.69

Seeking to build new LNG capacity—even with costly
mitigation measures—is illogical. Our analysis affirms
that the only reasonable response to the worsening
climate crisis is for the LNG industry to halt all new
construction, plan for phasing out existing capacity, and
simultaneously mitigate emissions.

APPLYING THE CLIMATE TEST TO FIVE PROPOSED LNG PROJECTSCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The DOE set up a climate test for LNG export terminals that was relatively generous in terms
of its assumptions for production-through-liquefaction GHG intensity and CCS availability. Yet
none of the assessed LNG terminals come near to passing it. Further, we show that measures to
reduce GHG emissions from the oil and gas industry, while important, are incapable of making
LNG compatible with climate goals.

The U.S. federal government has the tools that are
needed and a distinct responsibility to halt the
authorization of new exports. Prospective importers
and financial backers of U.S. LNG also have incentives to
consider the greenhouse gas emissions associated with
the fuel.

We make the following recommendations:

	| The DOE should use the “climate test” to reject

pending and future LNG export applications. Further,
the DOE should use its authority under the Natural
Gas Act to reevaluate the public interest status of
LNG projects that were authorized to export LNG to
non-FTA countries without consideration of climate
impacts or under analyses that predate the 2024 LNG
Study.

	| Congress should pass legislation that makes it a

statutory requirement under the Natural Gas Act to
assess the climate impact of gas exports and reject
applications that would increase global GHG emissions
under a credible scenario to limit warming to 1.5ºC.
U.S. federal agencies should require all new proposed
fossil fuel production and infrastructure projects to
meet a similarly high standard under NEPA.

	| Prospective buyers of U.S. LNG should refrain from
entering into long-term offtake agreements and
instead prioritize measures that accelerate the
renewable energy transition.

	| Financial institutions and governments should end
their financing for new fossil fuel infrastructure,
including LNG infrastructure, and plan for a
managed phase-out of fossil fuel assets. G7 nations,
in particular, should avoid using public money
to finance global LNG projects, as implied by the
G7 Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers’
Communiqué signed in 2022.70

	| Where it is not possible to entirely phase out

gas imports, foreign parties should insist upon
transparent, independent, and representative
measurement-based evidence to substantiate U.S.-
based claims of methane abatement (e.g., under the
European Union Methane Regulation).

DOE commissioned the first federal life cycle analysis
(LCA) study of U.S. LNG exports in 2014. According
to a routinely cited authorization order for Sabine
Pass, this study was “intended to inform DOE/FE’s
decision-making under NGA section 3(a) and to provide
additional information to the public.”71 An update to
the study was finalized in 2020, after which the DOE
immediately began to cite it in authorization orders for
projects such as Texas LNG and Rio Grande LNG.

A systematic review confirms that since 2014, all 28 final
authorization orders issued by DOE to export LNG to
non-FTA countries have cited LCA studies of the GHG
emissions associated with U.S. LNG exports. 17 of these
authorization orders were issued during President Donald

J. Trump’s first term in office. DOE prepared a standalone
LCA for Alaska LNG because the 2014 and 2019 studies
covered LNG exports from the lower 48 states only.

While this analysis demonstrates that DOE has been
prudent in considering GHG emissions under the scope
of its public interest analysis of LNG export applications,
studies that it has relied on have contained major
flaws. In particular, the studies do not assess whether
increased U.S. LNG export volumes may increase global
GHG emissions by contributing to a net increase in
fossil fuel production and consumption. Instead, they
compare the LCA emissions from U.S. LNG to the energy
equivalent emissions from coal and/or alternative
sources of gas.

The onshore gas production scenarios used by DOE
represent pairings of (1) clearly defined geologic
provinces coded by the American Association of
Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) and (2) extraction
technologies. Gas supply source regions used by RBN
are clearly defined for regions in Texas and Louisiana, as
well as the Northeast, but the boundaries of the MidCon
region are not clearly defined by model documentation.

Our crosswalk reflects the assumption that the RBN
MidCon region is well-represented by the Anadarko,
Arkoma, and South Oklahoma basins, and that the RBN
Other region includes all basins further west, namely the
Green River, Piceance, San Juan, and Uinta basins, as
well as Gulf of Mexico offshore production.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSSection S1. Calculation details for Calcasieu Pass liquefaction
stage emissions

To estimate liquefaction stage emissions for Calcasieu
Pass, we closely emulate the approach presented
in Step 3 of Appendix C of the 2024 LNG Study. This
approach uses company-reported GHG emissions from
the EPA GHGRP as the starting point (Table S1-1), and
uses additional calculations to fill “known data gaps”
and improve consistency with the assumptions used by
NETL. The calculations include:

	| Adding CO2 emissions from acid gas removal units
based on the “appropriate regional post-processing
NG [natural gas] compositions reported in the natural
gas baseline report and assuming that all CO2 is
removed from the pipeline gas and vented” 72 (Table
S1-2);

	| Recalculating CO2 and CH4 emissions from flaring
based on the reported amounts of natural gas sent
to flaring in Subpart W (Table S1-3) and assuming a
98% mass conversion efficiency from CH4 to CO2 with
the remaining 2% emitted as CH4. The results of this
calculation are shown in Table S1-4. 73

	| Recalculating speciated GHG emissions from fuel

use to address “minor differences in the combustion
factors used in the calculation of emissions from
GHGRP Subpart C data and those used by NETL in
its modeling.” 74 Fuel use volumes based on reported
data in Subpart C are shown in Table S1-5, and
recalculated GHG emissions by unit type based on
NETL fuel factors are shown in Table S1-6.

The final estimates for Calcasieu Pass, divided between
Subpart W and C emissions sources, are shown by
Tables S1-7 and S1-8.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSSection S2. Calculation details for project direct emissions
mitigation analysis

The cumulative emissions reductions associated with
four mitigation measures are estimated for the five LNG
terminals in our analysis and then summarized using
the production weighted average. This section explains
the assumptions and calculations used, as well as the
terminal-by-terminal results.

	| Optimizing gas supply. This measure assumes that
LNG operators purchase gas exclusively from the
supply region with the lowest production-through-
transmission GHG intensity for the delivery region
of the terminal: Southwest Texas for terminals in the
Southwest delivery region and Northeast Louisiana
for terminals in the Southeast delivery region. Due to
the complexity of the U.S. gas network, the limited
physical traceability of gas, the high share of gas
that LNG operators purchase from gas marketers
who do not provide sourcing information, and the
systematic exclusion of high emissions sources
from reported inventories, 75 we assume that further
measures to optimize gas supply purchasing would
not be indicative of additional emissions reductions.
Terminal-by-terminal calculations are provided in
Table S2-1.

	| Minimizing liquefaction stage methane emissions.
This measure assumes that LNG operators eliminate
all liquefaction stage methane emissions associated
with flaring inefficiencies, equipment leaks, and
blowdown methane emissions. For this estimation,
we first calculate the adjusted Subpart W GHG
emissions for each LNG terminal, consistent with the
approach described in Step 3 of Appendix C of the
2024 LNG Study (and emulated in Section S1 of this
report for Calcasieu Pass). To calculate the emissions
reduction associated with this measure (Table S2-2),
we assume that the CH4 emissions in the adjusted
Subpart W inventory are fully “avoidable.”

	| Using all-electric drivers. This measure assumes

that all LNG terminals use electric drivers for
liquefaction instead of on-site fuel combustion.
Similarly to the previous step, we first calculate the
adjusted Subpart C GHG emissions for each LNG
terminal. We also estimate the hypothetical power
consumption (and associated grid emissions) that
each terminal would require for operations. To
calculate the emissions reduction associated with
using all-electric drivers instead of on-site fuel
combustion, we substitute the adjusted subpart C
GHG emissions for each terminal with the estimated
grid emissions (Table S2-3).

To estimate the hypothetical power consumption
of each terminal, we use Freeport LNG’s power
consumption per ton of exported LNG. The grid
emissions intensity factor assigned to each terminal
is dependent on the state where the terminal is
located. For terminals in Texas, we use the same
grid emissions intensity factor as the 2024 LNG
Study, which is based on ERCOT generation mix data
and GHG emissions modeling using the NETL Grid
Explorer Tool. For terminals in Louisiana, we use a
consistent approach to estimate the grid intensity
factor using generation mix data for Louisiana from
the EIA and emissions modeling using the same NETL
Grid Explorer Tool.

	| Powering with renewable energy. This measure
assumes that all LNG terminals use high-integrity
renewable energy to power liquefaction. To estimate
the cumulative emissions reduction associated with
this measure (Table S2-4), we assume that the grid-
based emissions calculated in the previous step can
be reduced to zero.

FAIL ING  THE “CLIMATE TE ST”  |  32

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSThe baseline GHG intensity for this analysis, 15.3 g
CO2e/MJ LNG exported (LHV), is the production
weighted average across all five terminals of project
direct emissions (shown in Table 6). It is higher than the
default (average) project direct emissions calculated
by the 2024 LNG Study because the latter includes a
different sample of LNG terminals and assumes that the

average production-through-transmission intensity of
U.S. exports is well-represented by the average intensity
of the U.S. gas sector.

Detailed terminal-by-terminal calculations of adjusted
Subpart C and W emissions can be found in the
Supplementary Workbook to this report.

to CO2 emissions in non-U.S. countries reflecting the emissions impacts
of policies, whereas in the U.S. key provisions of federal policies such
as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are
represented explicitly (i.e., not through constraining emissions).

40  A 2021 review found the mean release rate of unburned methane from
liquefaction was 3.5 g CH4/kg LNG, about ten times higher (Balcombe,

41  The 2024 LNG Study includes a sensitivity analysis on pages C36-37

that finds the consequential GHG intensity of U.S. LNG exports is not
significantly affected by the upstream methane emissions rate. When we
sought to reproduce this analysis, we found results that contradict the
original findings.

56  Exhibit 2.3 in the 2024 LCA Study shows the percentages of U.S. onshore

gas supply in 2020 by basin and production type. It states the Permian
basin accounted for 16.85% of U.S. onshore production, with 7.09%
being unconventional and 9.76% conventional. Therefore, 58% of
Permian gas production was estimated as conventional in 2020.

57  Rystad Energy Ucube (April 2025) accessed by Oil Change International.

58  The definition of unconventional versus conventional may be different
across these assessments but may not explain NETL’s low estimate.
Different terms are used to define unconventional oil and gas production.
Unconventional production generally involves well stimulation methods
such as hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, as well as horizontal
or directional drilling as opposed to more conventional vertical
drilling. Shale and/or tight geological formations generally require well
stimulation and/or directional drilling. NETL defines unconventional as
horizontal drilling.
