Greenpeace April 2011

Our oceans are in peril. Despite the sustainable seafood movement
gaining steam globally, the devastation wrought by global industrial-
ized fishing continues on a massive scale. In spite of overwhelming
evidence and strong warnings from the scientific community, we
continue to plunder our seas.

While the oily gleam of sardines, mackerels, and other small,
rapidly-growing fish in wetcase ice is becoming more common,
most seafood merchants continue to focus on large, predatory
fish such as cod, sharks, and tuna. Globally, populations of these
ecologically vital animals have dropped by as much as 90 percent.
Bycatch remains a scandalous problem: each day, an enormous
portion of the world’s total seafood catch is tossed over the sides
of fishing boats due to inefficient, indiscriminate fishing methods.
The worst of the destructive fishing practices, bottom trawling, is
responsible for 80 percent of all bycatch incurred globally.

Even in these dark times, however, there is room to celebrate. This
is the fifth iteration of Greenpeace’s Carting Away the Oceans
(CATO) project, and there can be no doubt that over the past four
years, this report has tracked a current of progress and innovation
emanating throughout the seafood sector. Through progressive
policy development, public support for conservation measures,
and the elimination of unsustainable seafood inventory items, a
conventional mega-grocer—Safeway—has captured the top spot
from the previous standard-bearer, the Target Corporation. In doing
so, Safeway has underscored the reality that supermarkets from all
sectors can and must incorporate sustainability into their seafood
operations as the industry evolves. Indeed, we have now seen
the CATO pole position held by companies representing all three
grocery sectors included in this report: specialty (Whole Foods
twice in 2008 and Wegmans in 2009), big-box (Target in 2010), and
conventional (Safeway in 2011).

It is clear that certain markets have become deeply invested in
making better decisions and providing safer, more sustainable
seafood options for their customers. At the same time, an opposite,
dismal truth has become impossible to ignore: there are still numer-
ous seafood retailers that have yet to take any responsibility for the
seafood they sell, or for the damage they are doing to our oceans.

Throughout much of 2010 and into the first months of 2011, Green-
peace engaged in a direct campaign to expose the practices of one
of the worst historical performers in CATO rankings: Costco. In August
2009, the company’s lack of a sustainable seafood policy, misleading
labeling practices, and unsustainable inventory items led Greenpeace
to initiate a series of online and on-the-ground actions addressing
the company’s irresponsible behavior. Thankfully, Costco leadership
reacted relatively swiftly to the groundswell of dissatisfaction from
concerned customers and activists alike. In February 2011, the
company released a detailed sustainable seafood statement announc-
ing the discontinuation of nearly a dozen unsustainable species and
outlining a path towards real progress in the areas of aquaculture and
canned tuna.

This victory was the result of actions taken by tens of thousands of
people demanding change across the country. These activists took up
the call and confronted Costco directly: phone calls, letters, e-mails,
in-store demonstrations, and a number of other creative tactics.
Eventually, the company responded to the pressure from its customer
base, and we were rewarded with a store that—while still a long way
from perfect—has made impressive strides in the direction of becom-
ing a more responsible seafood operation.

Consumers deserve to be able to purchase seafood from retailers
that care about the condition of our oceans and that properly steward
our marine resources. The days of selling fish with no regard for
the environment are over. Companies have two choices—they can
implement strong seafood policies and become leaders, or they can
ignore reality and continue their unsustainable seafood practices until
many popular seafood items are no longer available. And increasingly,
if they choose the latter course, they will reap the wrath of a consumer
public that has simply had enough.

State of the OceansThe Role of Supermarkets
Supermarkets are one of our strongest connec-
tions to the oceans. Our relationship with fish is
largely one of predator and prey, and, for most
Americans, grocery stores are the preferred
hunting grounds.

KIDS PROBABLY AREN’T THINKING MUCH
ABOUT  SEAFOOD  NOW,
BUT  THEY  WILL  WHEN  THEY  GROW  UP,
AND  WE  WANT  THEM  TO  BE  ABLE  TO  ENJOY
HEALTHY SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD
JUST LIKE WE HAVE.

—PHIL GIBSON, GROUP DIRECTOR FOR SEAFOOD, SAFEWAY.

In the United States, consumers buy about
half of their seafood at the fish counter, but
conservation efforts in this arena have a history
of bypassing retail operations and concentrating
on the individual shopper. Unfortunately, this
method alone will not reduce pressure on our
fish stocks to acceptable levels—rather, the
supermarkets themselves must begin to partici-
pate in global ocean conservation.

Retailers have a tremendous amount of power
in the seafood industry. Over the past four
years, we have seen many companies begin
to engage in proactive, thoughtful actions:
ending objectionable projects, participating in
sector-wide conservation initiatives, and creat-
ing sustainable seafood policies that will enable
stores to continue to sell seafood in an ethical
and responsible manner far into the future.

Other retailers, however, have yet to get on
board. These industry laggards continue to
ignore the writing on the wall and refuse to
reform their behavior, electing instead to sell
unsustainable species without remorse. These

kinds of irresponsible actions highlight a general
disregard for our planet, our shared resources,
and our future. Companies that act this way do
not merit our patronage.

Call to Action

Greenpeace calls upon all seafood retailers to
enact strong, effective, sustainable seafood
policies that will reduce pressure on flagging
fish stocks by prohibiting destructive practices,
such as bottom trawling and other high-bycatch
fishing methods, and end purchasing from
unsustainable stocks. These policies must also
include protocols that increase overall transpar-
ency within the chain of custody, both to avoid
the spoils of pirate fishing and to provide
more information to the customer at point-of-
purchase. Retailers must begin to participate
more actively in the political process; they must
use their massive buying power to leverage
positive change in our oceans and to support
governmental initiatives that will create marine
protected areas (MPAs) and other measures
integral to a sensible, ecosystem-based fisheries
management approach. Lastly, responsible
retailers should demonstrate their commitment
to this process by removing unsustainable spe-
cies from their inventories immediately. If we are
to save our oceans from destruction, we cannot
continue to sell unsustainable species like shark,
orange roughy, and hoki. There is a better way
to sell seafood. It’s time for progressive retailers
to take the reins and lead the industry away
from the environmentally negligent practices that
have brought us to the brink of catastrophe.

A line in the sand: the US market is saying
no to orange roughy

Retailers that continue to sell
orange roughy

8

As of the time of writing, only eight compa-
nies—Delhaize America, Giant Eagle, Kroger,
Meijer, Price Chopper, Publix, SUPERVALU, and
Winn-Dixie—continue to sell orange roughy.
Many of these stores are in the bottom half of
the CATO rankings; In fact, with the notable
exceptions of Price Chopper and Delhaize,
these stores are the bottom six members of the
2011 CATO ranking list.

This is no coincidence. The science condemning
orange roughy fisheries is clear and unequivo-
cal. To sell such a critically endangered fish
is an insult to the very concept of sustainable
seafood. Any store with an effective sustainable
seafood policy would immediately be prevented
from engaging in this practice.

Greenpeace urges these remaining eight com-
panies to join the rest of the industry to evolve
beyond the wasteful and destructive practices
that underpin the orange roughy fishery.

When it comes to the worst of the worst,
enough is enough. Orange roughy is a fish that
can reach nearly one hundred years of age,
bears few young (by fish standards), and doesn’t
mature sexually until it enters its twenties, mak-
ing the species particularly unfit to withstand
the ravages of industrialized fishing. To make
matters worse, the world’s main orange roughy
fisheries—all found in New Zealand—use highly
destructive bottom trawl gear to capture these
animals. Management of these fisheries has
been shown again and again to be ineffective
and corrupt.

Thankfully, the US market seems to be running
out of patience with these fisheries. Over the
past year, store after store has discontinued the
sale of orange roughy, and momentum to move
away from selling orange roughy, bolstered by a
growing awareness among seafood customers,
is stronger than ever before.

In 2007, of all 20 retailers analyzed in the CATO
report, only Whole Foods and A&P—both of
which have gone on to become leaders in
sustainable seafood—had discontinued orange
roughy. The other 18 stores still sold the species.

By the end of 2008, Ahold USA, Target and
Wal-Mart had also dropped orange roughy.

In 2009, the sale of orange roughy ended in all
Aldi and Wegmans stores.

By the first quarter of 2010, Trader Joe’s had
also dropped orange roughy, clearly stating
that their decision was due to environmental
concerns.

By early 2011, Costco, Harris Teeter, H.E.B, and
Safeway had all ceased selling orange roughy.
Costco issued a public statement that used
orange roughy as a case-in-point example of
unsustainable seafood.

The rise of responsible retail: Companies
are taking a stand for the Ross Sea

There is other no place on Earth like the Ross
Sea. Known as the “Last Ocean”, the world’s
only remaining intact oceanic ecosystem serves
as mentor, teacher and living laboratory as we
strive to better understand the dynamic and
complex workings of life beneath the waves.

Thankfully, the marketplace itself is beginning to
revolt. The vast majority of the world’s Chilean
sea bass is sold in the United States, and, asso
far, two US seafood retailers have stood up to
this madness:

“Wegmans will not sell any seafood products
sourced directly from the Ross Sea due to
unresolved concerns over the fisheries, and
Wegmans believes a no-take Marine Reserve
would benefit this area.”—wegmans.com

“Safeway has pledged to not buy or sell toothfish
(Chilean Sea Bass) harvested from the Ross
Sea and encourages Conservation of Antarctic
Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) member
countries to designate the entire Ross Sea as an
MPA.”—safeway.com

It is no coincidence that the two companies
willing to take a public stand on such a critical
conservation issue also find themselves in the
top spots of this year’s CATO ranking. Green-
peace salutes the leadership at Wegmans and
Safeway, and urges all other seafood retailers to
join in the efforts to protect the Ross Sea and its
fragile ecosystem. We have a great deal yet to
learn about our oceans, and only the Ross can
educate us on the reality of how an intact ocean
actually functions. This knowledge is critical
if we are to truly understand how to foster a
sustainable and prosperous seafood industry.

page 9

Over the last several years, calls to protect this
area have grown louder as new voices joined
the chorus. Scientists and environmentalists
have aligned with policymakers and industry
representatives in a last-ditch effort to spare the
Last Ocean from the ravages of industrialized
fishing pressure.

Last year’s Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)
certification of the Antarctic toothfish (more
palatably termed Chilean sea bass in stores
and on menus) fishery in the Ross Sea was not
only a tremendous setback to these efforts, but
yet another black mark on the reputation of the
MSC. If the MSC’s standards allow for certifica-
tion of a fishery operating in an area proposed
by pre-eminent scientists and regulatory
authorities as a strong candidate for a no-take
marine reserve, the standards are clearly in
need of re-evaluation. It is hard to see what
could be sustainable about a fishery targeting a
slow-growing and mysterious animal that plays
such a key role as both predator and prey in the
Ross Sea. Have we learned nothing from our
mistakes elsewhere around the globe?

The face of change:
Where We Started/How Far We’ve Come

2008

2009

When Greenpeace first released Carting
Away the Oceans in 2008, the seafood retail
sector was in disarray. Not a single market
managed to attain a “Pass” in the first
round of scoring—even progressive retailers
like Whole Foods, Ahold, and Target were
found severely wanting. Orange roughy and
Chilean sea bass commonly appeared in
seafood cases across the country, and the
phrase “sustainable seafood policy” was
dismissed by merchandisers and executives
alike as a pointless pipe dream. The illusion
that the oceans were impervious to change
reigned supreme.

Over the next year, we began to see
movement. A few companies detached
themselves from the pack and began to
eke their way up the ranking list, developing
prototypical seafood policies and dropping
one or two red-list items. Customer aware-
ness grew as well, and across the country
concerned shoppers began asking ques-
tions about sustainable seafood.

page 10

Greenpeace April 2011

2010

2011

By 2010, significant progress was underway.
A handful of forward-thinking companies be-
gan to use sustainability and environmental
responsibility to distinguish themselves from
their competitors. Unsustainable species
like orange roughy and shark are disap-
pearing from seafood sections at a steady
clip. Over half of the top twenty seafood
retailers in the United States had crafted
seafood policies that have, to some degree,
reigned in unsustainable sourcing practices.
Companies like Safeway and Whole Foods
joined forces with independent third-party
environmental groups like FishWise and the
Monterey Bay Aquarium in order to improve
their operations and better promote sustain-
able seafood to their customers. And on the
CATO scorecard, over half of the companies
analyzed in the report attained a “Pass.”

As we enter 2011, the rate of change contin-
ues to accelerate. Five new companies have
entered the CATO “Pass” column, leaving
only five obvious laggards in the “Fail”
category. H-E-B’s total score increased by
3.6 points, the largest one-year jump of any
retailer in CATO history. Safeway has joined
Wegmans in calling for a no-take marine
reserve to encompass the Ross Sea, the
world’s last relatively pristine oceanic eco-
system. Four additional stores have dropped
orange roughy, three have ceased the sale
of Chilean sea bass, and one—Price Chop-
per—has eliminated shark.

The facts are clear. We, together—consumers, industry, activists, scientists—are changing the state of our planet
through our seafood choices. With every discontinued red-list species, every progressive stand taken by a
retailer, and every comment made by a concerned customer to a store manager, we find ourselves closer to our
overarching mutual goal: a healthy ocean, full of life, capable of sustaining us as we work toward the prosperity
that comes from thoughtful, responsible stewardship.

Certainly there is still a great deal of work to be done, but it’s important to recognize how far we have come.
Truly, the seafood retail sector is changing for the better—and not a moment too soon.

page 11

The face of change: Where We Started/How Far We’ve ComeWhat Consumers Can Do

In a perfect world, those who take their paychecks from the oceans would have the wisdom
and foresight to steward it properly for the good of all. Unfortunately, we are trapped by an
industry that has run roughshod over the treasures of the deep for too long, crushing them
with trawl nets, slicing them to ribbons in purse seines, and cutting their throats, thousands
at a time, in the name of short-sighted profit.

While some retailers have truly begun to step up and fight for a better world, many still resist
the obvious and continue to plunder our oceans. Faced with this reality, it is up to consumers
to make our voices heard and to demand the change we want to see in our oceans.

Four simple ways to heal the oceans at your grocery store:

1)   Speak your mind. Tell your seafood merchant that you’re concerned about overfishing,
bycatch, and ineffectual management. Demand to know the truth behind your seafood
options.

2)  Know the facts. Familiarize yourself with the Greenpeace red list items and other species

of concern in your area. Refuse to compromise.

3)  Vote with your dollar. Reward seafood merchants that are taking it upon themselves to
make sustainable choices. When your local store brings in a new, sustainable seafood
product, give it a try, and let the team behind the counter know you appreciate it.

4)   Eat less fish. Today’s demand for seafood far outstrips what can be delivered from

sustainable sources. While we work together to ensure that someday all seafood will be
sustainable, reducing seafood consumption now can help lessen the pressure on our
oceans, ensuring fish for the future.

page 12

Greenpeace April 2011

What Supermarkets Must Do

Retailers have the power to bring about enormous positive change in our oceans. The buying
power that these companies can leverage is strong enough to rebuild depleted stocks,
create protective measures for vulnerable habitat areas, and promote smart, strong fishery
management across the globe.

In order to accomplish these goals, retailers must address four specific tasks:

1)  Create an effective, publicly available sustainable seafood policy. Retailers that have

sensible guidelines governing their seafood practices are better able to ensure that they
are not causing undue harm to the oceans through their operations. Additionally, allowing
the public access to these policies increases transparency and allows consumers to
purchase seafood with confidence.

2)  Support initiatives and participate in partnerships designed to promote positive

change in the oceans. Retailers can no longer afford to ignore the political process
involved in ocean conservation and fishery management. If we are to safeguard our
oceanic resources for future generations, seafood merchants must begin to weigh in on
the side of conservation and responsible stewardship on a political level.

3)   Increase overall transparency in labeling, signage, and chain of custody. Sustainability
is impossible to achieve without establishing strong traceability mechanisms. This trace-
ability should be passed on to point-of-purchase, allowing seafood consumers to make
educated choices based on all available information. The usage of Latin names, FAO (the
UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization) catch areas, and other important data helps to
dispel the misrepresentation and confusion in the conventional seafood industry.

4)    Stop selling red-list species. There are some fisheries that simply should not be patron-
ized at this time due to stock depletion, overfishing, or irresponsible fishing methods.
Similarly, there are certain species of fish and shellfish that, based on their physiology
and life history, are unable to support significant
fishing pressure. Responsible merchants must
end the sale of these animals if we are to have
any chance of repairing the damage we have
done to our oceans.

Neck-and-neck: The race to
greener pastures

This is the fifth CATO report, but the checkered
flag has yet to wave. The first major retailer to
cross that 7 out of 10 line and enter the CATO
“green” retailer category will set an example
for the industry, not only by being first, but by
understanding that crossing this line is not the
end of the journey. Our planet is a dynamic
system, and sustainability is a moving target. A
company with its policies and internal sense of
responsibility developed to a high level will surely
understand this, and will continue to press
forward, ensuring fish for the future while raising
the bar for sustainable retail.

Here’s a breakdown of what some of the
front-runners could do for a nitro burst down
the home stretch:

Aldi: Aside from Target, no one can touch you
when it comes to red-list species. If you
clarify the information in your sourcing policy
and make the details publicly available, you’ll
be in great shape. You would benefit from
taking the Ross Sea pledge.

Ahold: You’ve got strong and determined

internal guidance and were one of the first
companies to get serious about Chilean sea
bass—take the Ross Sea pledge and make it
public. Consider strengthening your sourcing
policy when it comes to aquaculture.

Harris Teeter: You’re poised to become a leader

in transparency—keep it up. Add more
information to the website (FAO catch areas,
farming methods, etc) to help your customers
make even more informed decisions. Take
the Ross Sea pledge, lose the Chilean sea
bass, and shift to domestic sources for your
grouper.

Safeway: Welcome to the leading edge. Hold

on to it by publishing a serious canned tuna
policy that’s going to embrace pole-and-line
and FAD-free tuna, eliminate canned yel-
lowfin, and demand progress from the ISSF.
Use your purchasing power to support clean
aquaculture technologies, and get involved
in fishery improvement projects designed to
rebuild and strengthen key domestic fisheries.

Target: More than just about any other company,
you have an uncanny knack for innovation
and tackling the hard targets. Take on
another major challenge and own it, like you
did with the elimination of farmed salmon. Try
pushing the envelope with in-store labeling
and taking the Ross Sea pledge.

Wegmans: Your willingness to take ethical
stands on conservation issues and your
admirable seafood sourcing policy distinguish
you from just about any other retailer. Try to
take a critical look at some of the remaining
items in your inventory—drop the skate and
imported grouper. It might make sense to get
involved in fishery management projects re-
garding red snapper and swordfish. Consider
adding more information at point-of-sale.

Whole Foods: Your policy is second –to –none,
and the whole country sees you as a natural
leader here. The only issue is inventory,
but it’s a big one. The Earth Day plan is
fantastic, but resist the temptation to bring in
MSC-certified items when they’re still clearly
of serious environmental concern. Lose the
Atlantic halibut, the skate, and the hoki, and
take the Ross Sea pledge.

enormously in recent months. Safeway’s policy pre-
cludes the retailer from adding any new red list species
to its inventory, and thus many of the stipulations that
would trigger such a listing (destructive gear types,
high fish meal in feed, etc.) are immediately eliminated
from the realm of possibility.

It should be noted that this policy is not fully retroactive
yet; there are a number of red list species that Safeway
continues to sell which the company would not be
able to newly add to its inventory under these new
guidelines. Greenpeace looks forward to the further
application of this policy to remaining current inventory
species.

At the time of this writing, Safeway did not have a
sustainability policy regarding shelf-stable seafood.
Greenpeace is hopeful that such an initiative may be
underway.

Banners: Carr’s, Dominick’s, Genuardi’s, Pavilions,
Randall’s, Safeway, Tom Thumb, VONS

Background: Safeway is among the largest grocery
chains in the United States and operates over 1700 su-
permarkets under eight banners, mostly in the Western
and Southwestern regions, as well as in the mid-Atlantic
region and in Canada. Safeway offers a wide array of
grocery items, including store brand organic foods and
nontoxic household products.

Greenpeace Comments: Through a combination of
progressive policy decisions, inventory changes, and
remarkable public initiative support, Safeway has man-
aged to capture the top spot in this year’s Carting Away
the Oceans rankings. The amount of work necessary
to effect such dramatic change in such a sizable retailer
cannot be overstated, and Greenpeace congratulates
the team at Safeway for putting such effort into this task.

Key points of improvement include policy development
in both capture and farmed seafood sourcing, new
language aimed at promoting key conservation initia-
tives, a marked increase in available consumer-focused
information at point-of-sale and online, and a substantial
decrease in the red list species carried by the chain.

Greenpeace is thrilled to see Safeway on this trajectory
and eagerly awaits further developments in the coming
months and years. There is no doubt that it is compa-
nies with this sort of willingness to challenge paradigms
and assumptions – not to mention with the gumption to
take a public stand on important political conservation
issues – that will lead the charge into the realm of truly
sustainable seafood sales.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Safeway’s seafood policy
continues to expand in strong and meaningful ways.
While the policy’s complexities and details are not yet at
the level of retailers like Whole Foods or Wegmans, the
company’s purchasing guidelines have strengthened

page 16

Greenpeace April 2011

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Safeway is
emerging as a true leader, increasingly speaking
out in support of progressive marine policy in a
variety of different arenas.

Most notably, Safeway has recently published
language regarding the Ross Sea and its
commitment not to buy seafood from this area.
This position, pioneered first by Wegmans, has
now been echoed by Safeway, which further
strengthened their position with a public call
for a no-take marine reserve to encompass this
ecologically invaluable area.

Safeway continues to support the ongoing
MLPA process in California (creating protected
coastal marine areas) and seems poised to
increase its engagement in key fishery improve-
ment projects aimed at rebuilding stocks and
protecting areas of high biodiversity. It has also
promised to support protective measures for
Gulf of Mexico bluefin tuna spawning areas, but
this has yet to materialize.

Safeway’s partnership with FishWise, a
nonprofit environmental organization dedicated
to achieving a greater level of sustainability and
transparency within the seafood retail industry,
seems to be a driving force behind a great deal
of the progress demonstrated by the company.
Greenpeace salutes both organizations for their
increasingly remarkable contributions to ocean
conservation.

Safeway is also a member of the Food Market-
ing Institute’s Sustainability Task Force, as well
as its Sustainable Seafood Working Group.

Labeling & Transparency: Safeway has
increased the amount of information available
to its customers through the development of
in-store brochures and informational kiosks
as well as through the development of online
educational tools. The main principles and
parameters of the company’s sustainable
seafood policy are widely available in a variety
of forms (in-store brochures, CSR documents,
etc.), but some of the details used in the actual
purchasing process do not seem to be acces-
sible to the public.

Red List Seafood Sales: Safeway continues
to make important strides in this area. Most
recently, the chain discontinued sale of orange
roughy, a fishery known to be associated with
a number of destructive ecosystem effects. As
Safeway’s seafood policy strengthens, Green-
peace expects to see the chain make further
progress in this area through the discontinuation
of key red list species and/or the support of
particular fisheries that demonstrate an ability to
provide these products without causing undue
harm to our marine ecosystems.

Safeway currently sells ten of the twenty-
two red list seafoods: Alaska pollock, Atlantic

Banners: SuperTarget

Background: Target has built a successful “big box”
store concept based on low prices and trendy products.
Target’s grocery division, SuperTarget, offers groceries,
organic products, and household goods under one roof.
SuperTarget currently operates more than 218 grocery
locations in 22 states. Target is making significant
strides toward improving its seafood sustainability
as part of its overall mission to be a good corporate
steward of the environment.

Greenpeace Comments: Target has plateaued some-
what after capturing the top spot in the 2010 Carting
Away the Oceans rankings. That said, the company is
still making progress in key areas, and Target’s seafood
team continues to push forward in policy development
concerning both capture fisheries and aquaculture.

Like many other companies in this ranking, Target
received a slight decrease in its overall policy score this
year due to new information indicating that its seafood
policy does not currently apply to shelf-stable items.
Recent information from the company suggests that
this is likely to change in the near future. Greenpeace
encourages Target to focus more attention to shelf-
stable goods, such as canned tuna, as the company’s
policy continues to mature.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Communications from the
company indicate that Target’s sustainable seafood policy is
almost complete and should be publicly available in the near
future. Luckily, this policy is already being applied internally,
and has resulted in key positive decisions such as the
elimination of Chilean sea bass (Patagonian and Antarctic
toothfish).

In 2010, formative changes to Target’s policy resulted in
the discontinuation of all farmed salmon products due to
concerns over environmental degradation. In a press release
following the decision, Greg Duppler, Target’s senior vice
president of merchandising, announced that “Target strives
to be a responsible steward of the environment, while also
providing our guests with the highest-quality food choices.”

Historically, Target’s sustainable seafood policy has been ap-
plied most stringently to its own brands, Archer Farms and
Market Pantry, but the guidelines are now being used more
broadly. Target’s Food Safety & Quality Assurance team, as
well as third-party organizations, assess and monitor Target
seafood vendor programs. Target gives additional consider-
ation to vendors that demonstrate responsible harvest (wild
caught and farmed) and processing policies and practices,
as well as to certified products.

Red List Seafood Sales: Target has become
a true leader in this area. The company has
taken a tremendous step forward through the
elimination of Chilean sea bass, and is currently
working on addressing its remaining red list
inventory, which has now been reduced to only
seven of the twenty-two species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic sea scallops, ocean quahog, South
Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp,
and yellowfin tuna.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Target
is a member of the Food Marketing Institute’s
Sustainability Task Force and its subsidiary,
Seafood Working Group. In addition to working
with industry groups that represent producers,
processors, and conservation organizations,
Target also consults with seafood scientists on
its seafood sustainability and supports certifica-
tion groups such as the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC) and the Global Aquaculture
Alliance (GAA). Information from the company
suggests that new partnership endeavors are
underway.

Labeling & Transparency: Target is actively
incorporating seafood labeling and information
programs into its efforts to promote sustain-
ability. Moreover, recent messaging efforts
within the company regarding environmental
issues associated with conventional salmon
farming have been broadcast widely to its
customer base and to the media and industry at
large. Product-specific sustainability information
is disseminated through circulars and seafood
advertising campaigns.. While the items high-
lighted by Target as sustainable options may not
necessarily reflect Greenpeace’s perspective,
creating an avenue to present this type of
information at point-of-purchase is a major step
toward greater transparency.

Farmed products are sourced from suppliers that are
working to “minimize or eliminate the use of wild fish in
the feed, pesticides, and antibiotics.” Wegmans also
strives to avoid patronizing farms that cause undue
habitat alteration and/or land loss, are associated with hu-
man rights abuses, or source broodstock from red-grade
fisheries.

Wegmans actively seeks out products that have been
certified by bodies such as the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC) and works with outside conservation and
scientific groups to develop seafood sourcing standards.
Additionally, under Wegmans’ policy, products that are
not available from responsible sources will be removed
from the store’s selection. This directive has led Weg-
mans to eliminate several key red list seafood items from
its inventory. Unfortunately, over a dozen unsustainable
products can still be found in the Wegmans seafood
department.

Banners: Wegmans

Background: Wegmans is a family-owned chain of 77
supermarkets with outlets in New York, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland. In 2010, it was
ranked #3 in Forbes Magazine’s “100 Best Companies
to Work For.” Wegmans is consistently referred to as
a paragon of progressive and responsible retail, and
appears poised to grow considerably in the coming
years.

Greenpeace Comments: Wegmans continues to
prove itself a small-yet-mighty example of progressive
ocean stewardship. The chain sets a strong standard
for the industry, continuously striving to improve its
policy and to participate in important conservation
initiatives. Perhaps most impressive is the company’s
willingness to take progressive, ethical stances on
significant policy issues, such as their developing com-
mitment regarding the Ross Sea and their participation
in projects aimed at resuscitating the Chesapeake Bay.

The major area necessitating improvement is Wegmans’
overall inventory, which still contains more than a
dozen red list species. This is particularly troubling
given the fact that Wegmans’ own seafood sourcing
policy dictates that “when there is a sustainability
concern with a particular species, [Wegmans] works
. . . to acquire seafood that is caught responsibly and
prevents the depletion of natural resources. If we find
that a better alternative is not available, that item will
be removed from our selection.” In spite of this clear
directive, Wegmans continues to sell items like skate,
imported grouper, and Chilean sea bass, none of which
are available from sustainable sources.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Wegmans has a publicly
available sustainable seafood sourcing policy that incor-
porates guidelines for sourcing both wild-caught and
farmed products. Wild-caught items must be captured
according to local regulations and properly reported
and capture methods used must meet Wegmans
standards. Stock strength, bycatch rates, and social
impacts are also taken into account.

page 20

Greenpeace April 2011

Like many other companies in this ranking, Wegmans
received a slight decrease in its overall policy score this
year due to new information indicating that its seafood
policy does not currently apply to shelf-stable items.
Recent information indicates that Wegmans may be in
the process of expanding its sustainable seafood work
to encompass grocery.

Wegmans participates in the Food Marketing Institute’s
sustainability initiative and supports the “Common Vision
for Environmentally Sustainable Seafood,” an initiative
of the Conservation Alliance for Seafood Solutions that
aims to build an active partnership between conserva-
tion organizations and seafood retailers in support of
achieving sustainable fisheries.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Wegmans is a true
champion in this area. The retailer seems more willing
than nearly any other major grocer to take strong stands
on political conservation measures, both directly and
otherwise. A recent augmentation of the company’s
long standing Ross Sea pledge has added a call for
the establishment of a no-take marine reserve to the
pre-existing language that stated Wegmans’ decision
not to source seafood from the area. Wegmans has
also participated in the ongoing revitalization of the
Chesapeake Bay in a number of ways, both through
engagement with policymaking bodies (concerning blue
crab harvest regulations and quotas) and through its
supplier connections.

Wegmans’ chain of custody is certified by the Marine
Stewardship Council (MSC), a claim that very few US
retailers can make. Wegmans also uses Environmental
Defense Fund (EDF) guidelines in some areas of its
seafood purchasing, most notably farmed shrimp.

Labeling & Transparency: Wegmans is committed to
providing information about sustainable seafood to its
customers. The Wegmans sustainable seafood sourcing
policy is now available online and in print. Packaged
seafood that qualifies for sustainability statements is
discussed in the Wegmans Family Statement and, if
applicable, also carries the MSC logo. Wegmans
employees are trained to be knowledgeable about
seafood choices, labeling, and sustainability.

Red List Seafood Sales: The single greatest obstacle
preventing Wegmans from vaulting over the 7.0/10 mark
and achieving a “green” score in the Carting Away the
Oceans report is the company’s inventory. The company
often cites MSC certification as an excuse to continue
the sale of red list species; Greenpeace would highly
encourage Wegmans to eliminate key red list species
which have no sustainable source – skates and rays
(excepting invasives) and Chilean sea bass are excellent
examples of products that  fall into this category.

For the third year in a row, Greenpeace surveys found
that Wegmans sells fifteen of the twenty-two red list
seafoods: Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass, grouper, monk-
fish, ocean quahog, red snapper, redfish, skates and
rays, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

It should be mentioned that Wegmans is actively
engaged in sustainability projects within the categories
of South Atlantic albacore and tropical shrimp.

hormones, and poultry and mammalian by-products
may not be used in feed. Also included are strong trace-
ability measures that ensure farmed seafood is tracked
from farm to store. The slight decrease in Whole Foods’
policy score since last year’s report is a result of the
removal of language concerning the use of genetically
modified organisms (GMOs) in fish feed.

Although we note that Whole Foods has incorporated
the use of certification bodies into its seafood sustain-
ability policy, Greenpeace does not endorse any seafood
certification program, including the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC).

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Whole Foods sup-
ports sustainable fishing practices by actively partnering
with suppliers, the MSC, and other groups to encour-
age responsible practices. Whole Foods supports
the “Common Vision for Environmentally Sustainable
Seafood,” an initiative of the Conservation Alliance for

ship between conservation organizations and seafood
retailers in support of achieving sustainable fisheries.

Labeling & Transparency: Whole Foods uses a

(BOI). The program is designed to increase available

Background: Whole Foods Market, a rapidly expanding
company with more than 300 stores in the United States,
Canada, and United Kingdom, is the world’s largest
purveyor of natural and organic products. Whole Foods
claims to stay ahead of the growing consumer trend
toward sustainable living by constantly reviewing the
health, nutritional, and environmental impacts of the
products it sells.

Greenpeace Comments: Whole Foods Market is
among the most progressive members in the US seafood
retail sector. Although it has dropped to #4 in this update
of the Carting Away the Oceans project, the chain is
poised to potentially recapture the top spot.  Greenpeace
celebrates Whole Foods’ recent announcement detailing
the company’s plans to eliminate nearly all red list species
by Earth Day, 2012 – such progressive action will surely
have a tremendous positive impact on our oceans.

Unfortunately, at the time of this report, Whole Foods still
sold a tremendous amount of red list seafood species.
Whole Foods’ resistance to shifting its inventory away
from species like Atlantic halibut, Chilean sea bass, and
hoki is far and away the most significant impediment to
the chain clinching the pole position.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Whole Foods maintains
the strongest and most complex sourcing policy of any
of the twenty retailers examined within the context of this
report. While there is still room for improvement, Whole
Foods’ policy is indeed at the front of the pack in terms of
its comprehensive and science-based nature. In develop-
ing and implementing these standards, Whole Foods
called upon the expertise of scientists, environmentalists,
and the company’s suppliers. In addition, Whole Foods
provides suppliers with training on its standards.

Whole Foods’s extensive policy seeks out MSC-certified
products, eliminates certain unsustainable items from
potential sale, and invites the cooperation of independent
scientific and environmental organizations. Moreover, it
requires fish farms to minimize the environmental impacts

about the environmental benefits of frozen seafood,

Red List Seafood Sales: Recent announcements from
Whole Foods leadership indicate that the company is on
track to discontinue all red-list species over the course
of the next two years. As of Earth Day 2011, the chain
claims that it will only sell sustainably sourced tuna
and swordfish. Earth Day 2012 will see the subsequent
discontinuation of all other red list species except for a
few items from the Atlantic, which will be replaced by
Earth Day 2013. Greenpeace applauds this progressive
decision and looks forward to the culmination of Whole
Foods’ work. If the company does indeed discontinue
these species, there is little doubt that it will surpass the
7.0/10 score needed to qualify as a “green” retailer within
the context of this report – assuming that it doesn’t
simply use MSC certification as a shield.

Still, at the time of this writing, Greenpeace surveys
found that Whole Foods still sold  eighteen of the
twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaska pollock, Atlantic
cod, Atlantic halibut, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scal-
lops, bigeye tuna, Chilean sea bass, Greenland halibut,
grouper, hoki, monkfish, ocean quahog, red snapper,
redfish, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical

of Atlantic salmon, South Atlantic albacore, swordfish,
tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Background: Ahold USA is the US subsidiary of
Netherlands-based grocery giant Royal Ahold. In the
United States, Ahold operates approximately 750
grocery stores in New England and along the East
Coast.  Ahold continues to make significant strides
toward seafood sustainability, especially in the areas of
transparency to consumers and overall inventory.

Greenpeace Comments: Ahold is a consistent player
in the realm of seafood sustainability and has again
managed to improve its overall score by making key
decisions involving inventory. The company’s recent
decision to discontinue the sale of imported grouper
underscores Ahold’s slow-but-steady dedication to
sustainable seafood.

Like many other companies in this ranking, Ahold
received a slight decrease in its overall score this year
due to new information indicating that its seafood policy
does not currently apply to shelf-stable items.

Ahold could improve its overall score by strengthening
its sourcing policy (especially in the realm of shelf-stable
goods such as canned tuna); backing policy initiatives
such as proposed marine reserves; and continuing
to remove red list species, such as Atlantic cod and
bottom-trawled monkfish, from its product list.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Ahold has a ten-point
sustainable seafood policy that covers both wild-caught
and farmed seafood. Its sustainability program, Choice
Catch, aims to reduce the negative impacts of commer-
cial fishing. Ahold makes purchasing decisions based
on the results of seafood sustainability audits conducted
with the help of the New England Aquarium. Issues
addressed in its sustainable seafood policy include
avoiding illegally caught seafood; considering social,
ecological, and economic impacts; and supporting
scientific research and stakeholder initiatives aimed at
improving seafood sustainability. Ahold gives preference

to farmed seafood suppliers that are taking steps to
reduce the environmental impacts of their operations
as well as reduce the use of wild-caught fish for feed,
antibiotics, and pesticides.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Ahold supports
the Common Vision for Environmentally Sustainable
Seafood, an initiative of the Conservation Alliance
for Seafood Solutions, which aims to build an active
partnership between conservation organizations and
seafood retailers in support of achieving sustainable
fisheries. Ahold also chairs the Food Marketing
Institute’s Sustainable Seafood Working Group and
is involved in numerous other seafood sustainability
initiatives and related projects.

Ahold utilizes several seafood certification systems,
including the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC),
GlobalGAP, and the Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA).
Although we note these practices, Greenpeace does
not endorse any seafood certification programs.

Labeling & Transparency: Ahold currently leads the
retail sector in overall transparency. The company has
a publicly available sustainable seafood policy on its
website, and it also provides in-store information to its
seafood consumers. Ahold is also beginning to encour-
age consumers to avoid unsustainable species.

Background: Harris Teeter is an
upscale supermarket chain with over

Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Ten-
nessee, and Virginia. The company is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Ruddick
Corporation, which is based in Char-
lotte, North Carolina, and is Ruddick’s
most profitable company. Harris Teeter
is an expanding chain that offers store
enhancements like chef-prepared
meals, sushi, and organic and natural
products.

Greenpeace Comments: Harris Teeter
has made admirable progress over the
past year, including on-going policy
development, the establishment of
an online seafood information center
within the company’s website, and
the discontinuation of orange roughy.
These developments have resulted in
a significant increase in the retailer’s
overall score. Harris Teeter remains
#6 in the Carting Away the Oceans
rankings, but has drastically closed the
gap and is now within striking distance
of the top performers in the industry.

Harris Teeter’s stated goal is “to
offer top quality seafood while being
cognizant of the sustainability of supply,
environmental impact on marine life
and other species as well as social and
economic impacts.” Impressive recent
developments suggest that this goal is
indeed being taken to heart within the
company.

PASS

Greenpeace encourages Harris Teeter
to continue on its current trajectory by
eliminating red list items from its inven-
tory, and by augmenting its already
impressive online informational center
with further information, such as FAO
catch areas and aquaculture informa-
tion. The company could also improve
substantially by taking progressive
positions on key political initiatives,
such as petitioning for the development
of no-take marine reserves in the Ross
Sea or other important areas.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Harris
Teeter has a comprehensive set of
sustainable seafood procurement
guidelines that are regularly reviewed
and revised. These guidelines cover
both wild-caught and farmed seafood.
The company’s policy dictates that it
a) source wild-caught species from
suppliers of fisheries with management
systems that use scientific data and b)
seek out farmed seafood products with
minor environmental impacts, such as
domestic catfish, tilapia, and mussels.

Jennifer Thompson, spokesperson
for Harris Teeter, has informed Green-
peace that the company “is committed
to long-term partnerships with fisher-
men, communities, and suppliers that
practice and support responsible
fishing and sustainable management
of our rivers and oceans.” Additionally,
the company refuses to purchase any
trans-shipped product and requires
providers of certain farmed products
to be ACC certified. While Greenpeace
does not support the ACC certification
system, it does recognize the need
for traceability and progress within the
aquaculture sector.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives:
Harris Teeter is unique insofar as it is
the first US chain to explicitly implement
the Greenpeace Blacklist – the world’s
most comprehensive register of pirate
fishing vessels – in its sourcing guide-
lines; the company has stated that it will
not sell seafood that is traced back to
any ship on the Blacklist. Harris Teeter
is also in the process of developing full
traceability to vessel across all seafood
categories.

Labeling & Transparency: Harris
Teeter has recently unveiled a com-
prehensive new online informational
clearinghouse dedicated to seafood
transparency. Consumers browsing the
Harris Teeter website now have access
to an unprecedented level of informa-
tion about the seafood options sold by
the company. Greenpeace applauds
Harris Teeter’s progress in this area
and encourages the chain to continue
to add information to this well-designed
database.

Harris Teeter also provides consumers
with information on mercury in seafood.
To promote sustainable choices, Harris
Teeter provides extensive training for
seafood managers.

Red List Seafood Sales: In 2010,
Harris Teeter officially discontinued the
sale of orange roughy, one of the most
unsustainable products common to
the US seafood market sector. Recent
Greenpeace surveys found that Harris
Teeter continues to sell eleven of the
twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaskan
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass,
grouper, ocean quahog, South Atlantic
albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

sive FAO catch area labeling on all fresh/frozen seafood

by putting more effort into communicating the issues
surrounding seafood sustainability to its consumers, and
by increasing the overall amount of relevant information
available to them.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
Aldi sells seven of the twenty-two red list seafoods:
Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic sea scallop, ocean
quahog, South Atlantic albacore tuna, tropical shrimp,
and yellowfin tuna. Some of these items are only sold
during short periods of the year; Greenpeace would
urge Aldi to consider discontinuing these products
altogether in favor of more sustainable options.

Banners: Aldi

Background: The Aldi chain of supermarkets started in
Germany and now operates in eighteen countries. Aldi
has over 1000 stores across the United States, making it
one of the largest grocery retailers in the nation.

Greenpeace Comments: The team at Aldi has made
massive progress in the realm of sustainable seafood,
much of which has only recently come to light. Aldi sells
fewer red list items than any other major retailer; it is also
currently developing a comprehensive seafood policy and
working to improve its overall transparency.

Greenpeace applauds Aldi for its efforts thus far, and
expects the chain to continue to improve in this arena.
The company seems to be embracing the concept of
running a major seafood operation that does not hinge on
the sale of numerous unsustainable, red list items.

It should also be mentioned that while much of this
increase in Aldi’s overall score is due to recent develop-
ments, a portion of it is also reflective of pre-existing
information which, prior to this most recent survey,
Greenpeace—or Aldi customers—simply did not have
access.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Aldi has a seafood sourc-
ing policy that takes certain environmental issues into
account, but has not yet made it public and has an-
nounced no plans to do so. Greenpeace has based Aldi’s
policy score on what information was made available by
the company (cross-referenced with visible inventory.) It
is likely that this score will improve as more information
becomes available.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Aldi has stringent
policy-driven sourcing standards to which its suppliers
must conform. Additionally, Aldi is working closely with
Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP) and advocates for
improvements within the context of certification organiza-
tions such as the MSC and GAA.

A&P is a member of the Food Marketing Institute’s

Labeling & Transparency: A&P has improved sub-
stantially in this area over the past year. The company
has introduced new labeling practices that increase the
amount of information available to customers at point-of-
sale, including catch method (for wild fishery products)
and farm-level identification (for aquaculture products).
A&P also disseminates information to its customers via
in-store signage, flyers, and its website.

Red List Seafood Sales: This is the company’s
strongest area. A&P’s red list inventory has decreased
from last year with the recent discontinuation of grouper.
The company also claims to only source monkfish
caught exclusively via gillnet. This is a significant step
forward: due to positive stock recovery in the Atlantic,
Greenpeace no longer considers non-bottom trawled
monkfish  to be a red list item.

A&P continues to sell eight of the twenty-two red list
seafoods: Alaska pollock, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea
scallops, ocean quahog, South Atlantic albacore tuna,
swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Background: The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company
(A&P) is a sizeable player in the seafood retail sector
that concentrates primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region of
the United States. The company has recently filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and a number of its
outlets have been sold off to other retail operators in an
effort to slim the company back down to fighting weight.
At the time this report was written, A&P operated 395
stores under its six banners.

Greenpeace Comments: After re-engaging in sustain-
able seafood development a year ago, A&P has made
some progress in certain areas (most notably transpar-
ency) but has also taken some steps backwards.
Original commitments made in the areas of initiative
participation have not yet come to pass, and this has
brought the company’s score in that area down. At the
same time, A&P continues to increase the amount of
information available to its customers at point-of-sale,
and has made progress on removing red list species
from its overall inventory.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: This is A&P’s weakest
area. The company does not yet have a sustainable
seafood policy, but it is in the process of developing
one. Based on the current inventory of the retailer,
Greenpeace expects the policy will be quite strong once
it comes into effect.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: A&P has leveraged
its buying power to move its suppliers toward a more
sustainable sourcing system. Unfortunately, new infor-
mation has indicated that A&P has not met its previously
stated expectations in certain levels of supplier participa-
tion, and the company’s score has decreased slightly
in this area. That said, A&P demands that its suppliers
avoid purchasing products from vessels on the Green-
peace Blacklist, and is currently engaged in increasing
and promoting overall transparency throughout the

seafood operation. It has recently undertaken a project
to this end in conjunction with the Sustainable Fisheries
Partnership. The company is also in the process of
reviewing and assessing the standards put forth by

sea bass, and no longer sells Atlantic halibut or imported
grouper. Greenpeace applauds Price Chopper for taking
these actions, and strongly encourages the company to

species like orange roughy.

Greenpeace surveys found that Price Chopper sells
fourteen of the twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaskan

with 125 stores in New York, Vermont, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.
Price Chopper is privately held by the Golub family and
employees and, as the name suggests, offers low prices
on a variety of modern amenities like artisan breads,
custom-cut meats, trendy seafoods like sushi, and
natural, organic, and kosher products.

Greenpeace Comments: Price Chopper has improved
significantly since last year, making strides in initiative,
participation and in discontinuing four red list species,
including Chilean sea bass and shark. Greenpeace
applauds this progress and expects Price Chopper to
continue to improve as its sustainable seafood program
evolves. Given recent progressive endeavors undertaken
by the chain, Greenpeace would not be surprised to
see Price Chopper emerge as a true leader within this
category in the coming months and years.

Greenpeace would encourage Price Chopper to con-
sider engaging in public support for key political initia-
tives, like the creation of no-take marine reserves, as an
avenue for improvement.  Moreover, while Greenpeace
salutes Price Chopper’s progress, concern remains over
the number of red list species sold by the chain.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Price Chopper’s
sustainable seafood policy is undergoing development.
Although it is on the right track, it does not yet seem to
apply to certain categories within the seafood depart-
ment. The policy ostensibly prohibits the company from
selling certain items that are judged untraceable or too
unsustainable to be justifiable, but it has not forestalled
the sale of orange roughy. Greenpeace urges Price
Chopper to immediately cease selling orange roughy
and other particularly unsustainable species still carried
by the store.

Background: Delhaize America is owned by the
Belgian food retailer Delhaize Group, which has many
subsidiaries, including major supermarket chains that
operate over 1500 grocery stores in sixteen US states.
The company is making the most of the US market
trends toward organic and natural foods, especially in
its Sweetbay stores that focus on healthy living and
nutrition.

Greenpeace Comments: Delhaize continues to build
upon its recently established seafood sourcing policy,
particularly within the realm of aquaculture. The chain
continues to participate in fishery management initiatives
and is working to increase overall transparency within
the chain of custody.

That being said, the retailer lags far behind many other
progressive chains in its overall inventory. It is unaccept-
able that a chain moving such a tremendous volume
of seafood continues to sell inexcusable species like
Atlantic halibut, orange roughy, and sharks.

Greenpeace would strongly urge Delhaize not to go
down the path of developing a seafood sourcing policy
that, while comprehensive in scope, fails to prevent the
chain’s sale of even the most egregiously unsustainable
species (such as mako shark).

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Delhaize’s policy is
still very much a work in progress, but it does cover
all of the seafood sold by the chain (excepting pet
foods, which may be incorporated at a later date.) The
company’s policy currently states that it will “sell only
seafood from fisheries that are managed by competent
authorities and have a management plan in place that
incorporates a science-based approach to ensure
sustainability.” We are forced to question this language
in the face of some of the items that are sold at Delhaize
banners.

Greenpeace encourages Delhaize to revisit the language
in its policy regarding capture fisheries as soon as pos-
sible and consider whether or not certain items—such
as mako shark and orange roughy—should be removed
from sale given the company’s pledge.

Delhaize is on track to meet its goal of sourcing 100%
Aquaculture Certification Council (ACC) certified product
within its aquaculture categories. While Greenpeace
does not support the ACC due to numerous unresolved
concerns over the efficacy of the certification organiza-
tion, we do acknowledge the importance of regulation
and traceability within this sector.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Delhaize has begun
to pressure its suppliers to fall in line with the company’s
evolving sustainable seafood policy, thus serving as a
much needed lever for change within the industry as a
whole. That said, this seems to be more applicable to
aquaculture than capture fishery items – although the
chain has taken a stand on pirate-fished seafood and
refuses to purchase it.

Hannaford Brothers, one of the Delhaize banners, is
currently engaged in fishery management and improve-
ment projects with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute
(GMRI). While little specific information on these projects
was made available to Greenpeace, laudable goals such
as reduced carbon footprints, cleaner gear types, and
the sustainability of local fishing communities are being
targeted.

Labeling & Transparency: While Delhaize has signifi-
cantly increased the transparency of its seafood chain
of custody, none of the retailer’s banners sufficiently
label seafood products. Thus, Delhaize’s consumers are
unable to avoid purchasing destructively fished species.

Red List Seafood Sales: Even though Delhaize recently
discontinued monkfish, overall inventory continues to be
Delhaize’s weakest area – to the point where it begins to
call into question the effectiveness of the chain’s sustain-
able seafood purchasing policy. Delhaize must direct
its attention to eliminating red list species if it hopes to
progress toward a truly sustainable seafood operation.
Recent Greenpeace audits have revealed that the chain
currently sells an abysmal sixteen of the twenty-two
red list products: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic
halibut, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean
sea bass, grouper, ocean quahog, orange roughy, red
snapper, redfish, sharks, South Atlantic albacore tuna,
swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Banners: Costco

Background: Costco is the largest wholesale club
operator in the United States and operates about 530
membership warehouse stores that sell products in bulk
at below-retail prices. Costco serves more than fifty
million cardholders around the globe and in forty US
states.

Greenpeace Comments: Costco has recently
announced significant improvements to its seafood
operation, much to the delight of countless seafood
consumers and environmentally conscientious custom-
ers across the globe. The big-box titan endured a nine
month Greenpeace campaign before releasing a new
seafood statement detailing a litany of progressive
changes, including red list reductions, pledges to sup-
port progressive aquaculture, and the identification of
the need for serious attention to the canned tuna sector.

Greenpeace congratulates Costco on taking such
significant steps towards seafood sustainability, and
eagerly anticipates the positive change on the water that
will surely result from such a massive company begin-
ning to address the imperiled nature of our oceans.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Costco’s most recent
sustainable seafood statement, released in February
2011, is a formative policy that will likely be augmented
and improved in the coming months and years. Within
capture fishery products, the policy strongly ties the
company the company to the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC) and eliminates numerous red list
species previously sold by the company. While Green-
peace does not endorse the MSC due to numerous
unresolved issues, there is no doubt that the simple
act of complying with an outside certifier will lead –
and indeed, has already lead – to positive change.

Aquaculture initiatives are more long-term but they, too,
seem promising. The company’s language indicates
a pledge to pursue the ongoing Aquaculture Steward-
ship Council (ASC) development process, and then to
push for progress and reform among its current shrimp
and salmon suppliers. Given that the ASC shrimp and
salmon standards are still to be finalized, Greenpeace
does not yet have a position on their effectiveness.
The fervent hope is that both standards can facilitate
progress at a level that will make a positive impact to
these industries and to the ecosystems with which
they interact.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Costco is an active
participant in dialogues with World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
regarding the environmental and social impacts of
shrimp aquaculture. The company has also broadened
its partnership with WWF to include its wild-caught
species and is currently undertaking a category-wide
appraisal to discern how best to pursue further sustain-
able growth in this area. Beyond this, Costco defers to
its main salmon supplier, Marine Harvest, to represent it
within the ASC salmon aquaculture dialog, and largely
supports the International Sustainable Seafood Founda-
tion (ISSF) in the realm of canned tuna. Greenpeace
has a number of concerns about both the efficacy and
trajectory of the ISSF, and is hopeful that Costco’s new
path towards sustainable seafood will exert a positive
influence on the Foundation’s direction.

Labeling & Transparency: This is an area in which
Costco still has a great deal of work to do. While the
retailer should be congratulated for drafting a publicly
available seafood policy, the transparency does not
extend to point-of-sale. Beyond wild/farmed labeling,
Costco does not sufficiently label seafood products
so that consumers can avoid purchasing destructively
fished species.

Red List Seafood Sales: This has been an area of
massive improvement for Costco over the last year.
According to the company’s most recent statement on
this issue, it has ceased the sale of the following spe-
cies: Atlantic cod, Chilean sea bass, Greenland halibut,
grouper, monkfish, orange roughy, redfish, shark, skates
and rays, swordfish and bluefin tuna. Greenpeace
congratulates Costco on this remarkable achievement.

As significant as this announcement is, it is critical to
note two points that merit further clarification. The first
is that the company reserves the right to sell these
species if they are able to locate product certified by the
MSC. Greenpeace is concerned about this language
and will maintain a high degree of vigilance to ensure
that Costco does not use this clause as a back door to
return to the sale of key red list items, such as orange
roughy (should an orange roughy fishery ever gain MSC
certification). A second point is that a number of the spe-
cies indicated in the announcement were probably never
sold by the retailer in the first place – bluefin tuna is a
good example of this. All things considered, however,
there is no doubt that the company has made a serious
shift towards stocking sustainable seafood.

Recent Greenpeace surveys, as well as communications
from the company, indicate that Costco continues to
sells nine of the twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaskan
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea
scallops, bigeye tuna, ocean quahog, South Atlantic
albacore tuna, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Trader Joe’s is not
formally affiliated with any retailer groups, fishing industry
groups, seafood companies, third-party auditors, or
environmental conservation organizations working on
seafood sustainability. The company has indicated that
it is observing several developing aquaculture certifica-
tion systems, but is not yet prepared to adopt a single
standard.

Labeling & Transparency: Trader Joe’s does not yet
sufficiently label seafood products so that consumers
can avoid purchasing destructively fished species, but
it has begun to address this issue internally. A 2010 an-
nouncement by the company detailed plans to revisit its
labeling practices, but this has not yet come to fruition.
Greenpeace encourages Trader Joe’s to push forward in
this arena, as the company is highly vertically integrated
and may be more easily able to augment labeling on a
large scale than other, more conventional retailers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Trader Joe’s red list inventory
has not changed since last year’s Carting Away the
Oceans report. Recent Greenpeace surveys found
that Trader Joe’s sells nine of the twenty-two red list
seafoods: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea
scallops, bigeye tuna, Greenland halibut, South Atlantic
albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin
tuna.

Banners: Trader Joe’s

Background: Trader Joe’s operates more than 300
stores in at least 23 states and prides itself on offering
low prices and a wide array of single-serving and
prepared meals made with natural and organic ingre-
dients. Trader Joe’s buys directly from producers and
offers grocery products under its own private label.

Greenpeace Comments: Since announcing its sustain-
able seafood goals in 2010, Trader Joe’s has been
making slow but detectable progress. The company
has introduced several new seafood products that
underscore the shift towards sustainable options, and
reports that plans remains on track for it to make its goal
of discontinuing all unsustainable seafood products by
December 31, 2012.

Greenpeace is encouraged to see Trader Joe’s moving
forward, but hopes that some of the company’s long-
standing pledges – such as improvements in labeling
and the establishment of NGO partnerships – come to
pass sooner rather than later.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Trader Joe’s seems
to have an internal sustainable seafood policy in
place, but the parameters are not publicly available.
The overarching goal of eliminating all unsustainable
seafood products before 2013 will need a high degree
of attentiveness to many of the areas outlined in the
Greenpeace retailer survey, such as stock health and
capture method for wild fisheries, feed content and
waste management for farmed products..

Greenpeace encourages Trader Joe’s to offer its
customers more information on the choices behind its
products, and to elaborate on the benchmarks within its
sourcing policy.

Banners: Walmart, Sam’s Club

Background: Walmart is the world’s
largest retailer. It operates more than
7400 retail outlets in the United States
and in over a dozen other countries.
In addition to selling grocery items,
Walmart sells clothing, electronics, toys,
household merchandise, and other
goods. The company espouses three
main sustainability goals: to utilize 100
percent renewable energy, to create zero
waste, and to sell products that sustain
our natural resources.

Greenpeace Comments: Walmart has
made progress in certain key areas of
its seafood operation over the last year
(and especially in the month leading up
to release of this report). Unfortunately, in
other areas, the chain has actually slid
backwards since the 2010 iteration of
Carting Away the Oceans– partially due
to the reintroduction of red list species.
This is a particularly worrying develop-
ment due to the retailer’s immense size
and its tremendous draw on the world’s
fishery and aquaculture resources.

Walmart has only recently re-engaged
in the sustainable seafood movement
and its stagnation amidst the significant
progress made by many other retailers
has resulted in the company dropping
down the rankings, from #9 in 2010 to
its current rank of #13, despite its score
increasing slightly.

Greenpeace is encouraged by Walmart’s
announcement of new sustainable sea-
food policy measures, and encourages
the retailer to continue by strengthening
these commitments beyond simple
adherence to certification, and to adopt
a leading role in conservation initiatives.
Moreover, the company could prove an

labels products that are MSC-certified. In
2007,

Walmart introduced natural shrimp in
500 stores nationwide, using two labels
that described to consumers what they
were buying with the ACC standards,
both at the factory and farm levels. Since
2008, all shrimp purchased by Walmart
is certified by the Aquaculture Certifica-
tion Council.

Red List Seafood Sales: While Green-
peace celebrates the fact that Walmart
has recently discontinued Chilean sea
bass, it is both frustrating and baffling to
learn that the chain has recently re-
introduced two red list items: Greenland
halibut and redfish. One step forward,
two steps back, it seems.

Greenpeace surveys found that Walmart
sells twelve of the twenty-two red list
species: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod,
Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallops,
bigeye tuna, Greenland halibut, grouper,
hoki, ocean quahog, redfish, South
Atlantic albacore tuna, tropical shrimp,
and yellowfin tuna.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: In March
2011, Walmart released an updated
policy commitment that requires all
suppliers to either have attained certifica-
tion or have a plan to do so by June
2012. This policy applies to all fresh and
frozen seafood products (although not to
grocery or shelf-stable), both wild-caught
and farmed.

Walmart uses the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC) certification system as an
indicator for sustainability of wild-caught
species. The company is making prog-
ress towards its stated goal of selling only
certified wild species; that said, Walmart
still sells a tremendous amount of non-
certified wild-caught seafood every year.

Walmart uses standards developed by
the Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA)
and the Aquaculture Certification Council
(ACC) as a sustainability indicator for
farmed products. According to commu-
nications from the company, Walmart is
working with Global Aquaculture Alliance
(GAA) and Aquaculture Certification
Council, Inc. (ACC) towards ensuring
that its foreign suppliers adhere to Best
Aquaculture Practices (BAP) standards.

as Environmental Defense Fund, Conser-

Banners: H.E.B., Central Market

Background: H.E. Butt is one of the most successful
privately held grocers in the country and currently oper-
ates more than 300 stores in Texas and Mexico. H-E-B
takes a conventional approach to grocery retailing and is
expanding its offerings of non-grocery items in order to
compete with retailers like Wal-Mart, especially in urban
areas like Houston, TX.

Greenpeace Comments: H-E-B has demonstrated
impressive improvement since it finished at the very bot-
tom of last year’s Carting Away the Oceans report. H-E-
B’s recent survey response indicated the presence and
application of a sustainable seafood policy (although it is
still early in development), some participation in industry
and NGO-led initiatives, and a substantial decrease in
overall red list inventory. In fact, even though H-E-B is
ranked #14 in this year’s report, the company has leapt
from an overall score of 0.8/10 in 2010 to 4.4/10 in 2011,
a total increase of 3.6 points – the largest one-year shift
of any company in the history of this project.

H-E-B has only recently begun to provide Greenpeace
with access to the information necessary to accurately
assess the company’s performance in this sector. This
information is critical for this project to safely move be-
yond its reliance on strongly precautionary conclusions.
Much of H-E-B’s progress reflected in this iteration of
the Carting Away the Oceans report likely began some
time ago, but until now, Greenpeace has been unable to
acquire the relevant information.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: H-E-B has an internal
sustainable seafood policy. Little is known about the
policy and it appears to be undergoing development,
but it has resulted in important progressive decisions,
such as the elimination of orange roughy. The company
claims that this policy also extends to cover shelf stable
goods, such as canned tuna.

According to Dya Campos, Director of Public Affairs
for H-E-B, the company’s sourcing policy explicitly
precludes the sale of GMO seafood. Greenpeace
applauds this progressive decision on the part of H-E-B
leadership and strongly encourages other retailers to
follow suit in this area.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: H-E-B demands
that its suppliers adhere to the company’s sourcing
standards, including compliance with certification
organizations such as the Global Aquaculture Alliance
(GAA).  The company also works with industry-funded
groups as well as local NGOs on a host of issues related
to seafood sustainability. H-E-B is currently engaged
in a project aimed at reducing bycatch and unintended
mortality in Gulf of Mexico shrimp fisheries.

Labeling & Transparency: H-E-B disseminates
information on its website and in its stores concerning
seafood sustainability, but does not go into depth on the
detail of its sourcing policy or the products it chooses to
purchase. At point of sale, H-E-B does not sufficiently
label seafood products so that consumers can avoid
purchasing destructively fished species.

Red List Seafood Sales: H-E-B has joined the pack
of progressive seafood retailers that have turned their
backs on the abhorrently destructive orange roughy
fisheries in New Zealand and elsewhere. A statement
from H-E-B indicates that the company has discon-
tinued the species pending the depletion of current
inventory. Other species, such as shark and swordfish,
seem to have been discontinued as well, but it is unclear
how recently this occurred.

Information provided by the company (augmented by
recent Greenpeace in-store audits) indicates that H-E-B
still sells eleven of the twenty-two red list seafoods:
Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic
sea scallops, Chilean sea bass, grouper, ocean quahog,
red snapper, South Atlantic albacore tuna, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Background: Kroger is the nation’s largest grocery
retailer, operating nearly 2500 stores in 31 states. In or-
der to compete with other high-volume retailers, Kroger
offers discount prices on seasonal goods, merchandise,
grocery items, and perishables such as fresh seafood
and organic produce.

Greenpeace Comments: Over the past year, Kroger
has demonstrated measurable improvement in its
nascent commitment to seafood sustainability. The
company has dipped in the overall rankings this year, but
this is largely because of the more rapid progress made
by other retailers rather than by a lack of movement on
the part of Kroger.

Kroger’s ongoing partnership with the World Wildlife
Fund (WWF) is beginning to manifest in a broadening
commitment to the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC),
and the company also continues to push towards a
more comprehensive adoption of Global Aquaculture Al-
liance (GAA) aquaculture standards. While Greenpeace
does not support or endorse either of these certification
bodies due to a number of unresolved concerns, the
organization acknowledges the importance of progress
in the retailer’s sourcing behavior. Greenpeace is
hopeful that these partnerships will eventually result in
the discontinuation of species like orange roughy and
Chilean sea bass.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Kroger has now
developed a sustainable seafood policy that is aimed at
identifying the challenges posed by the major categories
of seafood sold by the company, and subsequently at
finding ways to improve these categories if necessary.
The company is pushing towards certification in both
capture and aquaculture categories. Greenpeace
strongly urges Kroger to act sooner rather than later and
to end the sale of key unsustainable species such as
orange roughy, hoki, and Chilean sea bass.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Kroger is
working a partnership with WWF to analyze the
species carried by the chain and determine a path for
progress. This work is still in early stages.

Kroger is a member of the Food Marketing Institute’s
Sustainability Task Force and its recently formed
Sustainable Seafood Working Group. The company
is engaged in the Aquaculture Dialogs, a WWF-led
multi-stakeholder effort to create standards for
aquaculture operations. Kroger also publicly
endorses the principles of the Conservation Alliance
for Seafood Solutions’ “Common Vision for Environ-
mentally Sustainable Seafood,” an initiative that aims
to build an active partnership between conservation
organizations and seafood retailers in support of
achieving sustainable fisheries.

Labeling & Transparency: Kroger’s new efforts to
investigate its seafood supply will certainly increase
transparency within the retailer’s chain of custody.
Kroger now offers some information on seafood
sustainability on the company’s website, but does
not provide any significant level of in-store labeling or
point-of-purchase information.

Red List Seafood Sales: Kroger recently issued a
statement announcing the discontinuation of shark
(as well as bluefin tuna and marlin.) This is an impor-
tant and powerful first step; after all, the company will
not be able to significantly improve until it begins to
remove unsustainable items from its inventory.

Greenpeace surveys found that Kroger stores still sell
sixteen of the twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaska
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea
scallops, Chilean sea bass, grouper, hoki, monkfish,
ocean quahog, orange roughy, red snapper, redfish,
South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical

Background: Publix is the largest employee-owned
supermarket chain in the United States. A fast-growing
chain, Publix currently operates over 1000 supermarkets
in five southern states and is quickly outpacing southern
competitors like Winn-Dixie. Publix is neither a “big box”
store nor a small neighborhood grocery – it offers basics
like dairy, produce, deli, bakery, and meat and seafood
counters, as well as an expanding line of GreenWise
Market items.

Greenpeace Comments: Publix still has yet to imple-
ment a sustainable seafood policy. The company last
year announced the creation of a “Publix seafood rank-
ing system,” but Greenpeace could locate no information
on the results of this ranking or on the system itself.

Publix does not offer any information on seafood
sustainability to its customers, and responses to Green-
peace inquires have been largely lacking in substance,
providing little information on any seafood developments
that may or may not be occurring within the company.

Publix sells a number of seafood species that are gener-
ally associated with serious sustainability concerns, such
as shark, orange roughy, and Chilean sea bass. Publix
would serve its customers, employees, and the oceans
well by ceasing its support for these destructive fisheries.

All of the information in this report is gleaned from
annual reports, industry data, consumer surveys,
publicly available information, and Publix customer
correspondence.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Publix does not have
any tangible sustainable seafood policy. The “Publix
seafood ranking system” was announced in May 2010,
but no information on the system, its parameters, or
its results has been made public. Whether or not this
system has had any effect whatsoever on Publix’s
seafood inventory is unknown.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Publix is working
with the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, but Publix
has not shared any details of the objectives or results
of this partnership with Greenpeace. Publix has also
partnered with the Ocean Conservancy on certain
issues, and is a member of the Food Marketing
Institute’s Sustainability Task Force.

Labeling & Transparency: Publix does not suf-

avoid purchasing destructively fished species, and the
company does not promote sustainable seafood to its

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: SUPERVALU has
teamed up with WWF to investigate the company’s
seafood operation. Whether this has yet led to any
improvements remains unknown as information on the
process is not publicly available and the company’s
inventory remains unchanged.

SUPERVALU is a member of the Food Marketing
Institute’s Sustainability Task Force, although it is difficult
to see that this has had any influence on the company so
far.

Labeling & Transparency: SUPERVALU does not
sufficiently label seafood products so that consumers
can avoid purchasing destructively fished species, and
the company does not promote sustainable seafood to
its customers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
that SUPERVALU retail banners continue to sell an
abysmal eighteen of the twenty-two red list seafoods:
Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea
scallops, Chilean sea bass, Greenland halibut, grouper,
hoki, monkfish, ocean quahog, orange roughy, red
snapper, redfish, shark, South Atlantic albacore tuna,
swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
that Winn-Dixie sells thirteen of the twenty-two red list
seafoods: Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallops, grouper, monkfish, ocean quahog,
orange roughy, red snapper, South Atlantic albacore
tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Banners: Winn-Dixie

Background: Since emerging from Chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy proceedings in late 2006, Winn-Dixie has been
renovating and rebuilding its grocery business. Head-
quartered in Florida, Winn-Dixie operates more than 500
grocery stores in the southeastern United States.

Greenpeace Comments: Winn-Dixie continues to
ignore all inquiries from Greenpeace about its seafood
policies and practices. Winn-Dixie’s inaction on seafood
sustainability results in its consistently low score on
Greenpeace’s seafood scorecard. Conscientious
consumers would do well to take note of the company’s
disregard for seafood sustainability and to shift their
purchasing dollars elsewhere. There is no reason that
we should reward a company that seems bent on
plundering our oceans with such callous disregard.

All of the information in this report is gleaned from annual
reports, industry data, consumer surveys, and publicly
available information.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Winn-Dixie does not have
a sustainable seafood policy.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Winn-Dixie is not
affiliated with retailer groups, fishing industry groups,
seafood companies, third-party auditors, or environ-
mental conservation organizations working on seafood
sustainability.

Labeling & Transparency: Winn-Dixie does not
sufficiently label seafood products so that consumers
can avoid purchasing destructively fished species, and
the company does not promote sustainable seafood to
its customers.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Meijer does not have a
sustainable seafood policy.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Meijer is not affili-
ated with retailer groups, fishing industry groups, seafood
companies, third-party auditors, or environmental
conservation organizations working on seafood sustain-
ability.

Labeling & Transparency: Meijer does not sufficiently
label seafood products so that consumers can avoid
purchasing destructively fished species, and the
company does not promote sustainable seafood to its
customers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
that Meijer stores sell fourteen of the twenty-two red list
seafoods: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass, Greenland
halibut, grouper, ocean quahog, orange roughy, redfish,
South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp,
and yellowfin tuna.

Banners: Meijer

Background: Meijer started as a tiny grocery shop
in 1934. Today, the privately held Meijer grocery chain
is one of the largest grocery retailers in the Midwest.
Meijer stores are open twenty-four hours a day, seven
days a week. In addition to selling groceries, Meijer
offers automobile services, household goods, in-store
restaurants, gas stations, and electronics.

Greenpeace Comments: Meijer has finally hit rock
bottom. The company still has yet to offer the slightest
acknowledgement of seafood sustainability in any way,
shape, or form. It’s not easy to perform so poorly given
the growth of sustainability awareness in the US seafood
sector, but Meijer has managed to soldier through, eyes
closed and hands clamped firmly over ears as the com-
pany comes to rest at the very bottom of the Carting
Away the Oceans rankings. Well, Meijer, congratulations
– it has taken four years, five surveys, and an astounding
ability to ignore reality, but you’ve finally done it: you are
officially the least sustainable major seafood retailer in
the United States.

All of the information in this report is gleaned from
annual reports, industry data, consumer surveys, and
publicly available information. All of the sarcasm in this
report is sourced internally from frustrated activists
that have run out of patience with this company’s total
disregard for the welfare of our oceans.

“That ranking you guys
do, I hate it. It takes up so
much time; it has made
my life a hell of a lot more
difficult. But I have to tell
you, it’s working. And I
want you to promise me
that no matter what I say
or what anyone else says,
you’re not gonna stop
doing it.”
