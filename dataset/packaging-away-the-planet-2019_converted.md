2019 SUPERMARKET PLASTICS SCORECARD

Packaging Away the Planet   2

This assessment should serve as a baseline measurement
of U.S. retailers’ sustainability performance on single-use
plastics.  All  retailers  profiled  in  this  report  received
failing  scores,  indicating  how  much  work  is  needed
to  urgently  address  the  plastic  pollution  crisis.
Current  initiatives  range  from  painfully  inadequate  to
small steps in the right direction. While a few companies
have  invested  effort  in  reforming  some  areas  of  their
overreliance  on  plastic,  not  one  has  done  enough  to
tackle the growing plastic pollution crisis. Unfortunately,
most retailers do not even know the extent of their plastic
footprints,  as  they  fail  to  track  the  plastic  packaging  of
their suppliers or even their own private label products.
As  the  public  demands  action  and  companies  sign  on
to  initiatives  like  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation’s
New  Plastics  Economy  Global  Commitment
to
eliminate  plastic  pollution  at  its  source,6  the  days  of  no
transparency and limited action are at an end.

This is a wake-up call. This is the moment for retailers to
envision their future. Will U.S. retailers lead in developing
innovative alternatives to wasteful single-use packaging,
or continue to make current and future generations pay
the price for their complacency?

Neither  policy  makers  nor  customers  are  likely  to  wait
long.

INTRODUCTION

lifecycle  of  plastic  production,  use,
The  entire
is  destroying  our  communities  and
and  disposal
environment.1  “[A]t  every  stage  of  its  lifecycle,  plastic
poses  distinct  risks  to  human  health,  arising  from  both
exposure  to  plastic  particles  themselves  and  associated
chemicals,”  and  most  people  worldwide  are  exposed
at  multiple  stages  of  this  toxic  lifecycle.2  Major  oil
companies  profit  from  sending  their  raw  material  to
plastics  manufacturers,  that  in  turn  pollute  (generally
lower-income)ii communities in the U.S. and abroad.3 As
plastics  continue  to  overwhelm  landfills  and  oceans—
and  even  invade  our  food,  water,  and  air—plastics
producers  are  seeking  to  increase  plastic  production  by
an additional 40% over the next decade,4 and quadruple
production  by  2050.5  The  impending  (and  unforeseen)
consequences  of  such  a  greedy,  irresponsible  growth
model are chilling.

Many  plastics  are  designed  for  single-useiii  purposes,
where  customers  have  a  product  for  mere  seconds  or
minutes  before  the  plastic  is  removed  and  disposed  of.
Most  single-use  plastics  are  not  or  cannot  be  recycled
properly,  and  thereby  end  up  polluting  our  oceans,
waterways,  and  communities,  negatively  impacting  our
health directly, as well as the health of land- and marine-
based ecosystems.

One  of  the  key  places  where  billions  of  people  interact
with  plastic  on  a  daily  basis  is  their  local  supermarket.
As  grocery  retailersiv  worldwide  start  to  address  their
plastic  footprints,  it  is  time  for  U.S.  retailers,  including
behemoths  like  Walmart,  Kroger,  Costco,  Albertsons
Companies,  and  Ahold  Delhaize,  to  take  demonstrable
action  to  markedly  and
immediately  reduce  their
plastic  footprints.  Greenpeace  has  more  than  a  decade
of  experience  evaluating  U.S.  retailers  on  seafood
sustainability.v  And  while  more  recent  Greenpeace
evaluations  have  increasingly  focused  on  single-use
plastics, this report is the first of its kind to evaluate how
major  U.S.  retailers  are  working  to  address  the  global
plastic pollution crisis.

ii  Low-income  communities  face  more  health  impacts  near  plastic  production  sites,  have  greater  exposure  to  toxins  and  waste,  and  bear  the  brunt  of  the  impacts  of  improper  plastic
disposal and incineration. See Jones, Van. “The Economic Injustice of Plastic.” TED, Nov. 2010, www.ted.com/talks/van_jones_the_economic_injustice_of_plastic#t-257079.
iii Single-use refers to any product or packaging that is intended or designed for one-time use, regardless of the recyclability of any component materials.

v  Similar to Greenpeace’s findings when it first started evaluating retailers on seafood sustainability, retailers nationwide are doing next to nothing to address the plastic pollution crisis.

Significant Findings

This report assesses 20 U.S. retailers with a significant national or regional presence. None of the 20 profiled retailers
achieved  a  passing  score  and  none  of  the  profiled  retailers  has  ambitious,  comprehensive  commitments
commensurate with the scale of the plastic pollution crisis. Very few retailers have plastic reduction targets at all,vi
and  not  one  appears  to  have  absolute  reduction  targets  (i.e.,  reducing  the  total  number  of  plastic  packaging  units
instead  of  merely  lightweightingvii  them).  Most  retailers  have  limited  data  about  their  plastic  footprints,  and  even
fewer seem willing to report with the level of transparency needed to assure the public that they are indeed reducing
their plastic footprints. Given the urgency of the problem, the scale of these retailers’ operations, and their customers’
rapidly growing concerns about plastic pollution, Greenpeace expects to see considerable change over the next year.

• While  falling  just  short  of  a  passing  score,  ALDI  is  the
highest-ranked  retailer.  ALDI  has  several
initiatives
that  most  other  retailers  do  not:  a  specific  plastic

reduction plan, greater transparency, and a commitment

comprehensive  plastic  reduction  plan.  Like  Albertsons
Companies  (3rd)  and  Walmart  (6th),  Kroger  is  largely
focused  on  recycling  and  lacks  transparency.  However,
its  recent  partnership  with  Loop  could  signal  promising
change  if  Kroger  invests  more  heavily  in  reuse  models.

• Albertsons  Companies  (“Albertsons,”  ranked  3rd)  is

unable to more fully report on their initiatives.

The Plastic Pollution Crisis

We  can  no  longer  ignore  the  growing  public  health
and  environmental  crises  perpetuated  by  plastics,  nor
plastics’  contribution  to  catastrophic  climate  change.
Many retailers that tout their climate goals neglect to talk
about the massive amounts of single-use plastic products
they sell every day that are produced from oil and gas.

Fracking  is  a  highly  destructive  method  of  natural  gas
is  poisoning  communities  and  has
extraction  that
led  to  a  surplus  of  natural  gas  in  the  U.S.8  That  same
natural  gas  from  fracking  is  a  cheap  feedstock  that  has
incentivized  major  oil  companies  to  turn  excess  fossil
fuels and chemicals into plastic. Oil companies like Shell
and ExxonMobil have invested more than $180 billion in
new plastic production facilities,9 10 11 which is grim news
when  scientists  already  caution  plastic  production  is
creating  “near-permanent  contamination  of  the  natural
environment.”12

Plastic  production  releases  carcinogenic  and  other
highly  toxic  substances  into  the  air.  The  effects  of
exposure  to  these  substances  include  “impairment
of  the  nervous  system,  reproductive  and
developmental  problems,  cancer,  leukemia,
and genetic impacts like low birth weight.”13
Workers  and  communities  near  refining  facilities  can
“face  both  chronic  exposures  and  acute  exposures  due
to  uncontrolled  releases  during  emergencies.”14  And  the
destructive life of plastics has just begun.

Single-use  plastics  are  used  for  moments  and  then  last
lifetimes.  Plastic  never  goes  away;  it  fragments  into
smaller  pieces  that  disperse  throughout  the  natural
environment.15  Fragmented  plastic  particles,  including
microplastics,xi  are  found  in  the  food  we  eat,16  the  water
we  drink,17  and  the  air  we  breathe.18  Toxic  microplastics
are eaten by marine animals,19 which are then consumed
by  people  all  over  the  world  as  seafood.  And  plastic  is
literally  everywhere—from  the  deepest  points  in  our
oceans20  to  remote  mountain  peaks.21  Scientists  have
documented  nearly  700  marine  species—including
seabirds,
turtles,  and  whales—impacted  by  ocean
plastics.22  Up  to  9  in  10  seabirds,23  1  in  3  sea  turtles,24
and  more  than  half  of  whale  and  dolphin  species  have
ingested  plastic.25  A  dead  whale  that  washed  up  on
a  Philippine  beach  in  March  2019  was  found  to  have
ingested an incredible 88 pounds of plastic.26 In April, an
emaciated  baby  dolphin  died  after  being  stranded  on  a
Florida beach—it had eaten plastic bags.27

As  plastics  enter  the  food  chain,  a  growing  body  of
research  is  looking  into  their  pervasiveness  and  health
in  human
impacts.  Microplastics  have  been  found
stools,28  indicating  that  we  may  be  routinely  exposed  to
them through the food we eat. Microplastics can also act
as  carriers  for  toxic  pollutants  and  additives,  perhaps
delivering  such  chemicals  more  directly  to  the  body
tissues of animals that have consumed them.29 And even
the  simplest  plastics,  including  those  mass-produced
single-use plastics for food packaging, can act as sponges
in the environment, absorbing and building up a burden
of  persistent  organic  pollutants  over  many  years.30
Synthetic microfibers are even smaller than microplastics
(smaller  than  a  human  cell)  and  shed  off  of  clothing.
Some  scientists  estimate  that  the  average  person’s  body
contains  3–5  million  synthetic  microfibers,  which  exhibit
toxin-absorbing  capabilities  that  may  exceed  those  of
microplastics.31

We  are  only  beginning  to  fully  appreciate  the  full  scale
of the human health impacts associated with this grand,
destructive experiment. If the impact of plastics on animal
health is any sign, humans may also be headed toward a
public health crisis.32

food  providers,

including  retailers,  should  be
All
concerned  about  the  potential  health  impacts  of  toxic
additives and food packaging chemicals that are in direct
contact  with  food,  since  few  of  these  chemicals  have
had  health  risk  evaluations.33  Per-  and  polyfluoroalkyl
substances  (PFAS)  are  chemicals  of  particular  concern.xii

They have been linked to damage of the liver and immune
system, as well as cancer,34 and are frequently used as a
lining  on  paper  food  containers,  such  as  those  used  at
self-serve  salad  and  hot  bars.35  Concerns  are  growing
about  the  impacts  on  reproductive  health  of  several
endocrine-disrupting  chemicals,  such  as  phthalates,
bisphenols,  and  styrene,  which  are  commonly  used  in
single-use  plastics.  The  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics
has  urged  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  to
review  these  chemicals,  and  has  recommended  that
people  avoid  heating  food  in  plastic  containers  and  use
alternatives to plastic whenever possible.36

We are entering a new era of culpability and liability when
it  comes  to  the  harm  that  plastics  can  have  on  human
health.  According  to  Greenpeace  USA  Oceans  Director
John  Hocevar,  “it  may  be  just  a  matter  of  time  before
companies  using  plastic  packaging  have  their  own  ‘Big
Tobacco  moment,’  where  executives  are  called  to  testify
in court as to what they knew about the health impacts of
plastic packaging, when they knew it, and what they did
about  [it].”37  When  studies  showed  preliminary  evidence
that  plastic  harms  human  health,  the  scientists  involved
reported  industry  intimidation  when  they  attempted
to  speak  publicly  about  their  findings.38  The  harm
that  discarded  plastic  products  produce  in  our  shared
environment,  as  well  as  potential  harm  from  the  direct
transfer  of  toxic  substances  from  what  was  formerly
believed to have been food-safe plastic onto the food that
we eat, may soon be an area ripe for litigation, particularly
if  it  can  be  established  that  the  plastics  industry  was
aware of these harms.

Throughout  its  entire  lifecycle,  the  threats  of  plastics
persist  from  production  to  use  and  disposal.  Plastics
remain in our environment and continue to release toxins
even  after  their  temporary  utility  is  long  gone.39  When
considering  the  true  cost  of  plastic,  paying  such  a  heavy
price for its often frivolous and fleeting uses is ludicrous.

Why We Cannot Recycle Our Way Out of the Problem

The  companies  that  stand  to  financially  profit  from
this  broken  system  are  also  the  same  actors  that
promote  recycling  as  the  solution.40  41  Many  consumer
goods  companies,xiii  such  as  Nestlé,  PepsiCo,  and
Procter  &  Gamble,  have  corporate  social  responsibility
(CSR)  initiatives  that  place  responsibility  on  the  end
consumer.42  43  44  45  46  Most  of  these  initiatives  focus
(i.e.,
on  recycled  content,  “optimizing”  packaging
lightweighting),xiv  and  better
items  for
(potential) municipal recycling.

labeling  of

Even countries with more robust recycling infrastructure
fail  to  effectively  recycle  plastic.  In  2015,  the  U.S.
recycled only 9.1% of its plastic waste,49 which is usually
downcycled.xv U.S plastic recycling rates could even drop
to  as  low  as  2.9%  in  2019.50  Globally,  more  than  90%  of
all  plastic  ever  produced  has  not  been  recycled.51  The
staggering  amount  of  plastics  in  our  oceans  alone—
estimated  to  be  more  than  5  trillion  pieces,  weighing
more than 250,000 tons52—is testament to the worldwide
failure of recycling.xvi

In  a  consumer  goods  company  survey  conducted  by
Greenpeace  International  in  late  2018,  none  of  the
profiled  companies,
including  Nestlé,  Coca-Cola,
PepsiCo,  Unilever,  and  Danone,  had  commitments
to  substantially  move  away  from,  or  reduce  their
dependence  on,  single-use  plastic  packaging.47  Every
corporate  commitment  made  by  these  companies
endorses a business as usual approach, allowing the total
amount of single-use plastic packaging units to continue
to grow.48 Unfortunately, several of the profiled retailers
in  this  report  have  also  sought  to  over-emphasize  the
consumer’s responsibility in curbing the plastic pollution
crisis.

China  recently  halted  imports  of  nearly  all  foreign
trash  and  recyclable  waste,  including  from  many  U.S.
cities,  which  resulted  in  an  increase  in  waste  exports  to
Southeast Asia.53 Many U.S. cities now resort to landfilling
formerly  recycled  items54  or  disposal  practices  typically
associated  with  developing  countries—burning  trash.55
Incredibly, six times more plastic waste is burned in the
U.S.  than  is  recycled,56  and  globally,  of  all  the  plastic
ever  produced,  more  has  been  burned  than  recycled.57
Burning  plastic
is  known  to  release  carcinogenic
pollutants,  which  lead  to  a  wide  array  of  debilitating
human health impacts.58

xiii  The consumer packaged goods sector represents one of the largest industries worldwide. It is mainly comprised of companies that supply low-cost products that are in constant high
demand, such as food, drinks, personal hygiene, and household cleaning products. These “fast-moving” items, purchased on a regular basis by households, are nondurable with a short
shelf life, and are mostly sold at a low profit margin in high volumes.
xiv Greenpeace recommends a complete phase-out of single-use plastic packaging, and that retailers focus on reducing the total number of single-use plastic units instead of lightweighting.
Regardless of whether it is conventional or lightweight plastic, if that plastic enters the environment it will still have detrimental effects.
xv When the resulting material after the recycling process is of a lower quality and/or functionality than the original material, and cannot be used to make the original product again. This is
contrasted to an aluminum can, which can be recycled and made into another identical aluminum can.
xvi Additionally, agriplastics (plastic sheeting that is used as crop cover, greenhouse covers, and drip tape) from farming are difficult to dispose of and are often burned or abandoned,
thereby ending up in local waterways. Similarly, abandoned fishing gear pollutes beaches and our oceans, and can entangle and kill marine life.

Unbelievably, retailers like Albertsons, Target, and Hy-Vee
participate  in  the  Hefty  EnergyBag  Program,59  which  is
marketed  as  a  “solution”  to  reclaiming  non-recyclable
plastics.  The  Hefty  EnergyBag  Program  misleads
consumers  and  distracts  from  real  solutions  like  plastic
reduction  and  reuse.60  61  Well-intentioned  customers
purchase  these  bags  and  place  their  non-recycled
plastics in them, and then those plastics are incinerated
or  turned  back  into  fossil  fuels  which  are  later  burned.xvii
This  program  has  been  linked  to  burning  plastics  in  a
Missouri-based  cement  kiln  that  violated  the  Clean  Air
Act.62 63

Between  the  strong  likelihood  that  the  plastic  destined
for  “recycling”  is  actually  being  burned,  and  the  reality
that even recycled plastic is actually downcycled and has
little economic value, recycling alone is not the answer:
we cannot recycle our way out of this problem (for more,
see  page  15).  The  only  way  to  reverse  this  trend  is  to
completely  reimagine  the  way  products  are  produced,
shipped, consumed, and disposed of. We need an entire
redesign and immediate focus on reusable products and
closed-loop systems—not more corporate greenwashing.

The only way to reverse this trend is to completely
reimagine the way products are produced,
shipped, consumed, and disposed of.

Legislative Efforts and Changing Consumer Attitudes

Legislation  and  rapidly  changing  consumer  attitudes
are  creating  yet  another
incentive  for  retailers  to
move  quickly.  As  concerns  about  plastic  pollution
grow,  municipalities,  countries,  businesses,  and  people
worldwide  are  taking  action.  Many  governments  are
banning  different  types  of  single-use  plastics—most
commonly, plastic bags. Morocco used to be the second-
largest  plastic  bag  consumer  after  the  U.S.,  using  about
3  billion  plastic  bags  a  year;  in  2016,  it  banned  plastic
bags  nationwide.64  China,  India,  Italy,  and  France,  and
more  than  a  dozen  African  countries  have  some  form
of  plastic  bag  ban.65  66  In  2018,  the  EU  adopted  the
European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy67 to
help  “transform  the  way  plastic  products  are  designed,
used,  produced,  and  recycled.”68  Then,  the  European
Commission proposed new rules to target the 10 single-
use plastics most commonly found on Europe’s beaches
and  in  its  seas,  employing  both  ban  and  reduction
strategies,69  which  were  further  amended  in  January
2019.70

Plastic  bag  bans  have  been  successful  in  dramatically
reducing plastic bag litter in Washington, D.C., California,
Texas,  New  York,  South  Carolina,  Ireland,  and  the  UK.71
Several  U.S.  states  have  plastic  bag  bans  (California,
Hawaii,  and  New  York)  or  are  actively  considering
proposals in state legislatures.72 73 74 Seattle’s plastic straw
and utensil ban took effect in 2018,75 and just north of the
border Vancouver, B.C. has voted to ban the distribution
of  plastic  straws  and  polystyrene  take-out  containers
and cups, to take effect in June 2019.76 As of this writing,
Berkeley,  California’s  citywide  ordinance  to  eliminate
restaurant  waste  made  of  single-use  food  packaging  by
2020 is the most forward-thinking approach in the U.S.77

Unfortunately,  as  communities  increasingly  take  action
on  the  worsening  plastic  pollution  crisis,  the  chemical
and plastics industries and front groups like the American
Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) have responded with
efforts  to  protect  corporate  profits  via  mass-produced
preemption  bills  meant  to  “ban  plastic  bans”  in  several
U.S.  states.78  79  But  the  tide  of  preemptive  single-use
plastic  bans  may  be  turning.  Florida’s  governor  recently
vetoed  a  preemptive  ban  on  plastic  straws.80  And  even
industry spokespeople sometimes forget to stick to their
pro-plastic propaganda. An American Chemistry Council
staff  member,  while  attempting  to  defend  polystyrene
foam products in Colorado and avoid their replacement,
admitted  that  recyclable  products  do  not  necessarily
mean that they will actually be recycled.81

resisted
Some  consumer  goods  companies  have
proposed  legislation  on  plastic  pollution.  For  example,
in October 2018, Nestlé, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Danone
lobbied EU member states to scrap a proposal that would
force  beverage  companies  to  attach  plastic  bottle  caps
to  bottles  (to  reduce  marine  plastic  pollution).82  83  Note
that these are among the same beverage companies that
produce  roughly  500  billion  single-use  plastic  bottles
annually.84

While  segments  of  the  oil,  plastics,  and  chemical
industries  and  some  consumer  goods  brands  may  be
opposing efforts to reduce plastic use, other large players
in  the  private  sector—namely,  retailers—are  starting
to  take  responsibility  for  addressing  the  plastic  crisis.
UK  retailer  Iceland’s  managing  director  has  stated,
“The  onus  is  on  retailers,  as  leading  contributors  to
plastic  packaging  pollution  and  waste,  to  take  a  stand
and  deliver  meaningful  change.”85  In  April  2019,  Metro
Inc.  (“Metro”),  the  third-largest  supermarket  chain  in
Canada,  took  a  significant  step  toward  reuse  and  refill
options  by  permitting  customers  in  Quebec  to  use  their
own  reusable  containers  for  ready-to-eat  meals,  meat,
seafood, and pastries.86

Many  smaller  grocers  have  opened  zero-waste  grocery
stores  that  eliminate  single-use  plastics
from  all
transactions  and  incorporate  reuse  and  refill  systems.
The  Wally  Shop  in  Brooklyn  relies  on  a  closed-loop
delivery  system:  staff  members  fulfill  customer  orders
with  items  from  local  farmers  markets  and  bulk  food
stores,  bike  couriers  deliver  those  orders  in  reusable
packaging,  and  during  the  next  delivery,  that  same
packaging  is  picked  up  for  reuse.87  88  The  company
plans to expand across New York City and in other cities
nationwide. Similar store formats also exist in Vancouver,
Berlin,  Vienna,  Barcelona,  Hong  Kong,  Kuala  Lumpur,
Bangkok,  Italy,  and  South  Africa.89  90  91  92  93  94  95  Further
examples  of  closed-loop  systems  can  be  found  in  the
Solutions and Distractions section (see pages 14 and 15).

Among  American  millennials,  plastic  pollution  is  now
perceived to be a threat on par with oil spills, which has
long  been  their  top  concern.  Further,  millennials  expect
action: 64% surveyed believe that we are likely to make
progress  in  reducing  the  flow  of  plastic  pollution  into
our  oceans  in  the  next  five  years.96  U.S.  retailers  would
be  wise  to  get  ahead  of  changing  laws  and  consumer
attitudes—now.

Retailers Must Raise the Bar for Private Label & National Brands

Retailers  are  massive  contributors  to  plastic  pollution
and  will  play  a  pivotal  role  in  either  exacerbating  or
solving  the  global  plastic  pollution  crisis.  Retailers
are  gatekeepers  of  which  products  appear  on  shelves
or  online,  and  can  determine  which  national  brand
products  to  buy.xviii  This  is  a  critical  element  in  reducing
waste  further  up  the  supply  chain,  especially  among
consumer goods companies.

In  October  2018,  the  Break  Free  from  Plastic  movement
revealed  the  results  of  239  cleanupsxix  and  brand  audits
spanning 42 countries and six continents, which included
surveying  more  than  187,000  pieces  of  plastic  trash.
The  most  frequently  found  polluted  items  came  from
Coca-Cola,  PepsiCo,  and  Nestlé  products.97  As  one  of
the  largest  food  companies  in  the  world,  Nestlé  sells
more  than  1  billion  products  a  day,  98%  of  which  come
in  single-use  packaging.98  In  2018  alone,  the  company
produced  1.7  million  metric  tons  of  plastic  packaging.99
Greenpeace  urges  consumer  goods  companies  to  move
away  from  their  polluting  packaging  models  and  for
retailers  to  leverage  their  buying  power  to  expedite  this
transition. If retailers require reuse and refill options from
Nestlé and other consumer goods companies, Nestlé and
others  will  have  no  option  but  to  innovate  in  order  to
remain relevant.

To  counter  the  recent  decline  in  market  share  among
large  consumer  goods  companies,100  101  and  an  erosion
of  brand  loyalty  and  brand  shifting  by  consumers,  one
industry expert has advised consumer goods companies
to  “invest  in  innovation  that  meets  a  constant  need
is  no
for  change,”  as  “lifetime  consumer
longer  a  valid  goal.”102  Many  people  surveyed  across

loyalty

60  countries  view  private  label  brands  as  equivalent
to  multinational/national  brands.103  Furthermore,
millennials “are very value conscious, they do a lot more
product  investigation  before  buying,  and  they  will  buy
private-label  brands  if  they  think  they  are  as  good  as
multinational brands.”104

In  addition  to  raising  packaging  standards  among
national  brands,  retailers  can  shift  how  they  source
and  sell  private  label  products,  from  produce,  seafood,
meats,  baked  goods,  shelf-stable  products,  and  ready-
to-eat  meals.  Minimizing  food  waste  and  ensuring  food
safety are a focus for both retailers and consumer goods
companies.  However,  as  single-use  plastics  continue  to
flood our environment, kill marine life, and threaten our
health,  food  waste  and  food  safety  cannot  be  used  as
excuses  to  delay  moving  away  from  single-use  plastics.
Companies  must  eliminate  unnecessary  packaging  and
employ  alternative  delivery  systems  and  new  business
models  that  preserve  food  without  sacrificing  safety
or  longevity.  They  can  even  realize  benefits  with  this
approach.xx

Highly  vertically
integrated  retailers  with  a  heavy
emphasis  on  their  own  brands—such  as  ALDI,  Trader
Joe’s,  and  Costco—could  make
immediate  and
significant  reductions  to  their  overall  plastic  footprints.
Based on the aforementioned consumer trends, retailers
should  be  more  optimistic  in  providing  reuse  and  refill
delivery systems for their private label products. Many of
today’s more value-conscious shoppers may favor these
more  sensibly-packaged  private  label  alternatives,  and
possibly drop national brands that fail to keep up.

xviii Consumer goods companies are responsible for astounding amounts of plastic waste, including Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Mars, Danone, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo. For more,

xx A supermarket chain in New Zealand found that its sales of produce increased by 300% once it eliminated plastic wrapping and foam trays. See Martinko, Katherine. “‘Nude Shopping’

Nestlé Needlessly Nestles 98% of Its
Products in Single-Use Packaging
In  the  Global  South,  especially  Southeast  Asia,  Nestlé
promotes  and  profits  off  of  a  sachet  economy.xxi
Given  the  widespread  poverty  in  several  parts  of  this
region,  lower-income  customers  typically  can  only
afford  to  buy  smaller  amounts  of  food  or  personal
care  products.  Instead  of  selling  smaller  amounts
of  products  (like  instant  coffee  or  soap)  in  a  bulk
system where customers can bring their own reusable
containers  to  purchase  the  right  amount,  Nestlé
and  other  companies  have  prepackaged  virtually
everything  in  disposable,  single-use  plastic  sachets.
These  small,  flexible  packages  are  unrecyclable
and of little to no value to waste pickers, so they end
up  overwhelming
landfills,  clogging  streets  and
waterways, and are frequently burned, emitting toxins
into the air.

According  to  a  recent  report  by  the  Global  Alliance
for  Incinerator  Alternatives,  Nestlé  and  Unilever  are
responsible  for  a  quarter  of  the  branded  throwaway
plastics  driving  the  plastic  pollution  crisis  in  the
Philippines.105  The  companies  were  named  the  top
polluters based on a series of brand and waste audits
conducted  in  conjunction  with  a  university’s  research
center  in  six  cities  and  one  province  in  the  country.106
So what is a viable alternative? Read about innovative
startup  Algramo  in  the  box  to  the  right  and  about
other alternative delivery systems in the Solutions and
Distractions section on pages 14 and 15.

Algramo Leads the Way on
Accessible, Refillable Dispensing
With  more  than  2,000  vending  machines  across
Santiago,  Chile,107  and  expanding  into  neighboring
countries,  startup  company  Algramo  (“by  the  gram”)
found  a  way  to  “replace  sachets  and  other  single-
use  plastic  packaging  by  dispensing  products
into  small  reusable  containers.”108  The  company’s
founder  launched  the  vending  machine  concept  to
tie  in  directly  with  neighborhood  shops  in  the  poorer
outskirts  of  Santiago.  He  noticed  that  accessibility  to
food  was  lacking,  and  most  staples  were  priced  too
high  for  those  who  could  not  afford  bulk  purchases.
Algramo vending machines feature reusable containers
that fill 500-gram portions of common staples like rice,
beans, and lentils.109 110

As a result of the enormous success of these machines,
the  company  has  now  launched  detergent  containers
with  smart  chips  that  allow  users  to  receive  money
back each time they refill the bottle at a touch-screen
kiosk (and they are also informed on how much plastic
they  prevented  from  entering  the  environment).111
Algramo  designed  a  convenient  and  affordable  reuse
and  refill  system  that  can  meet  the  needs  of  the
developing world. If a startup can do it, then there is no
excuse for a multibillion-dollar company like Nestlé to
delay and in the process continue polluting our planet
with single-use plastic sachets.

xxi The sachet economy refers to the practice, especially in poorer communities, where companies sell consumer products—such as detergent, shampoo, powdered milk, and beverages—in
small, single-use disposable plastic packages that cannot be recycled.

THREE WAYS RETAILERS MUST ACT

1. Be Transparent

3. Invest in Innovation

It  is  hard  for  some  to  imagine  a  supermarket  without
single-use plastics. Yet for many readers, their parents or
grandparents spent most of their lives shopping for food
that was not wrapped in single-use plastics, and reusing
containers  was  the  norm.  Combining  the  less  wasteful
practices  of  prior  generations  along  with  modern-day
technologies  presents  exciting  opportunities  to  turn
things  around.  Retailers  must  implement  currently
available  technologies,  innovate  new  solutions  for
reusable  and  refillable  delivery  systems,  and  engage
consumer  goods  companies  to  design  scalable
alternative delivery models.   For examples of sensible
alternative  delivery  systems  and  precautions  to  avoid
common  pitfalls,  read  the  Solutions  and  Distractions
section on pages 14 and 15.

Retailers  must  track  and  annually  disclose  their
use  of  plastic,  including  the  number,  composition,
and  weight  of  items  containing  single-use  plastics.
Without a baseline, retailers cannot measure subsequent
reductions  (or  growth)  in  their  plastic  footprints.  In
addition,  retailers  must  ask  for  their  suppliers’  plastic
usage data and about their suppliers’ initiatives to reduce
their reliance on single-use plastics.

2. Prioritize Reduction

Retailers  must  publicly  commit  to  phase  out  single-
use  plastics
immediately,  and  achieve  absolute
reductions  in  the  total  number  of  single-use  plastic
packaging  units  (not  simply  lightweighting  existing
products).  Retailers  should  prioritize  eliminating  the
most  problematic  and  unnecessary  plastics  that  are
harmful  to  human  health;  that  regularly  enter  the
environment;  that  are  not  recyclable,  or  often  end  up
in  landfills  or  incinerators  despite  recyclability  claims;
and  that  have  existing  alternatives.  Problematic  and
unnecessary  plastics  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,
polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC),  bags,  black  plastic,  expanded
polystyrene, cups, and multilayered packaging. Retailers
must  transition  to  alternative  delivery  systems  that
promote  reuse,  not  simply  switch  from  one  throwaway
material  for  another.  Finally,    retailers  must  establish
supplier  standards  for  packaging  and  engage  large
national brandsxxii to rethink their polluting packaging
models and pilot alternative delivery systems.

SOLUTIONS AND DISTRACTIONS

Solutions

Greenpeace  encourages  retailers  to  innovate  by  adopting  solutions  that  address  the  root  of  the  problem  instead
of  replacing  one  throwaway  material  with  another.  While  Greenpeace  does  not  endorse  particular  companies  or
products, the following are examples of reusexxiii and refill strategies to reduce reliance on single-use plastics.

Reuse and Refill

Reusable  packaging—either  customer  provided  or  via
retailer  take-back  schemes,  or  coupled  with  in-store  or
at-home  refill  techniques—can  drastically  reduce  single-
use  plastics.  Refill  strategies  can  be  broken  up  into  four
categories:

• Refill at home: Where customers purchase a concentrated
form of a product (either in store or via mail) and use their
own water at home to mix it at the correct concentration
(e.g., Blueland112 or Splosh113  cleaning products).

• Refill  in  store:  Where  customers  can  bring  in  their
own  containers  to  refill  common  foods  and  household
cleaning  products.  In  addition  to  reforming  preexisting
bulk  dry  goods  sections  to  allow  reusable  containers,
retailers can consider other examples of bulk dispensing
(e.g.,  olive  oil,  coffee,  honey,  Ecopod  kiosks  where
customers  can  refill  one-time  purchased  and  reusable
branded containers with household soap, detergent, and
cleansers).114

• Return  from  home:  Where  customers  can  either  ship
back  used  packaging  or  return  it  to  participating  stores
for  cleaning  and  refilling  (e.g.,  Loop,  where  reusable
containers of food or personal care products from about
20 national brands are shipped to customers in reusable
tote bags).115

• Return  in  store:  Where  customers  bring  back  the
reusable  container  and  purchase  another  of  the  same
product.  The  customer  does  not  necessarily  receive
the  same  exact  container,  because  of  either  safety  or
practicality  reasons,  but  that  returned  container
is
cleaned,  inspected,  and/or  refilled  (e.g.,  reusable  glass
milk bottles).

Transforming Cafés

As  retailers  like  Whole  Foods,  Wegmans,  and  Kroger
invest  in  in-store  bars,  customers  may  now  spend  more
time in stores and be more willing to forgo disposables for
reusable foodware. Foodservice management companies
have  employed  cost-saving  measures  that  reduce  waste

Packaging Away the Planet   14

by  piloting  Clean  Water  Action’s  ReThink  Disposable
program.116  These  measures  are  directly  relevant  to
profiled retailers in this report, as most have in-store hot
meals, cafés, and delis.

Pharmaceutical company Genentech piloted the ReThink
Disposable  program  at  one  of  its  corporate  campus
cafés,  which  is  operated  by  Bon  Appétit  Management
Company. Over one year, Genentech reduced one million
pieces of disposable packaging and saved $12,000.117 The
University  of  San  Francisco  campus  diningxxiv  reduced
more than 2.6 million pieces of disposable packaging with
ReThink Disposable, saving more than $157,000 annually.118

In  addition  to  this  program,  there  are  other  ways  to
implement  reuse  and  refill  systems  in  stores.  Initially
geared  toward  the  to-go  coffee  industry,  CupClub  is
a  reusable  cup  subscription  service  where  used  cups
can  be  dropped  off  at  any  participating  store.119  GO
Box  offers  a  similar  system  for  take-out  meals.120  Vessel
offers  reusable,  insulated  stainless  steel  mugs  from
participating  cafés,  which  can  be  returned  either  to  the
cafés or to a deposit kiosk after use.121 As larger retailers
pilot  programs  where  customers  can  bring  their  own
reusable  containers  for  fresh  food,122  retailers  could
eventually forgo offering disposable to-go containers in the
first place.

Full Spectrum

A  comprehensive  approach  to  reducing  single-use
plastics also requires alternative food provision systems.
local  food  that
Retailers  should  prioritize  sourcing
is  fresher  for  customers  and  does  not  rely  on  distant
transport and excessive packaging to protect the food on
its  long  journey  to  the  store.  In  addition  to  buying  from
local farmers, retailers can partner with local hydroponic
and aquaponic farms to source items, such as lettuce and
other  leafy  greens,  to  reduce  plastic  waste,  and  provide
fresher  food  for  customers.  For  foods  that  need  to  be
shipped long distance, package-free delivery systems are
a viable option.

Distractions

Any serious efforts to address plastic pollution must include source reduction. Unfortunately, the urge to maintain the
status quo is perpetuating a variety of “solutions.” Retailers must avoid these distractions and opt for leadership, not
greenwashing.

Retailers Can No Longer Hide Behind Recycling

The  plastics  industry  has  long  argued  that  recycling  is
the way to address the plastic pollution crisis, in an effort
to shift the blame to consumers and thereby sidestep its
own  massive  role  in  creating  this  crisis.  This  approach
cleverly allows plastics producers to expand their plastic
footprints (and revenue) while attention is focused on the
culpability of the end users of their products. Dr. Marcus
Eriksenxxv has noted that spinning public narratives about
litter  to  focus  on  recycling  has  “been  a  way  to  deflect
attention  and  responsibility  for  product  design  away
from  industry,  and  [it]  has  been  very  effective.”123  The
same argument that places blame on the individual also
empowers  that  same  person  with  an  exaggerated  sense
of being a good steward—that by making a choice to toss
a plastic bottle in the recycling bin, consumers are doing
their part to protect the planet. Nothing could be further
from the truth.

Globally,  only  9%  of  the  plastics  ever  made  has  actually
been  recycled,124  and  some  experts  project  2019  U.S.
plastics  recycling  rates  could  drop  below  3%.125  Plastic
bags and dirty plastic to-go containers are both examples
of non-recyclable items that people nonetheless attempt
to  recycle—a  phenomenon  waste  managers  refer  to  as
“aspirational  recycling.”  These  items  regularly  jam  and
clog  automated  recycling  machines,126  or  contaminate
a  batch  of  recycling.127  Clearly,  recycling  and  consumer
education alone will not fix this mess.

Labels Will Not Solve the Plastic Pollution Crisis

As  more  and  more  retailers  make  pledges  to  add  the
How2Recycle  label128  on  plastic  packaging,  it  begs  the
question: What do they hope to accomplish? No amount
of  labeling  will  solve  broken  recycling  systems,  nor
stop  the  petrochemical  industry’s  plans  to  significantly
ramp  up  plastics  production.  Rather  than  label  plastic
packaging,  retailers  should  stop  single-use  plastics  from
being  made  in  the  first  place.  That  means  prioritizing
reduction, reuse, and refill systems.

Where Is Our Plastic Waste Going?

investigations

Until  recently,  a  majority  of  the  exported  plastic
waste from the U.S. went to China and Hong Kong.129
Then,  overwhelmed  by  the  sheer  volume,  China
banned importation of most foreign waste. In 2016,
760 million tons of plastic waste were shipped from
the  U.S.  to  China—that  figure  dropped  by  95%  in
2018  after  China  imposed  these  strict  standards.130
In search of a quick solution, exports to other Asian
countries  skyrocketed.  Field
in
Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand  detailed  illegal
recycling  operations  and  crime  syndicates,  open
burning, water contamination, crop death, and a rise
of  illness  tied  to  environmental  pollution,  spurring
many  to  follow  China  and  impose  import  bans.131
Since  late  2018,  Thailand,  Vietnam,  and  Malaysia
have  all  banned  plastic  waste  imports.132  In  May
2019, the United Nations voted to amend the Basel
Convention  to  now  require  exporting  countries  to
obtain  the  consent  from  an  importing  country’s
government  before  sending  contaminated,  mixed,
or non-recyclable waste.133

A system that relies on U.S. cities to ship barges of plastic
waste to the other side of the world in the hope that they
can recycle a fraction of the contents is severely broken.
This  loss  of  an  overseas  release  valve  also  has  direct
impacts on the health of Americans. As U.S. communities
are forced to take more responsibility for their own waste,
a startling 81% of all domestic plastic waste is landfilled,
and  six  times  more  plastic  waste  is  being  burned  in  the
U.S.  than  recycled.134  A  Guardian  investigation  in  early
2019  found  that  “this  new  reality  risks  an  increase  of
plumes  of  toxic  pollution  that  threaten  the  largely  black
and  Latino  communities  who  live  near  heavy  industry
and dumping sites in the US.”135 Retailers cannot remain
on the sidelines while their operations contribute to the
increasing public health and environmental threats from
plastic pollution.

xxiii Reusable products and packaging are constructed of durable materials and designed to achieve multiple uses in their existing form without any physical or chemical modification. To
qualify as reusable, there needs to be a reuse system in place that ensures the item is reused where it is placed on the market, and is able to prove a significant actual reuse rate.
xxiv Also operated by Bon Appétit Management Company.

Great Lakes, which resulted in the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015. See www.5gyres.org/team.

Bioplastics, Biodegradable, and Compostable Materials Miss the Mark

In response to growing public concern over conventional
single-use  plastics,  many  companies  are  swapping
single-use  plastics  derived  from  fossil  fuels  for  other
throwaway items. Bioplastic (or bio-based plastic) refers
to plastics made from biomass resources, such as sugar,
starch, vegetable oils, and plant matter.xxvi Bioplastics may
be  either  biodegradable  or  non-biodegradable.  Several
companies—for  example,  Coca-Cola,136  Danone,137  and
Nestlé138—are  using  bioplastics  to  replace  some  portion
of  conventional  fossil-derived  plastics  in  their  beverage
bottles. Several profiled retailers are engaging in material
substitution,  such  as  Wegmans  shifting  to  bioplastic
produce  bags,139  Trader  Joe’s  replacing  expanded
polystyrene  with  compostable  trays,140  and  several
retailers switching to paper straws.

While  often  promoted  as  sustainable  alternatives  to
conventional  plastics,  biodegradable  plastics  can
pollute  as  much  as  their  fossil-based  equivalents.141
The  heat  and  humidity  conditions  required  for  specific
microorganisms  to  biodegrade  these  materials  are
rarely, if ever, met in the natural environment—whether
at  land  or  at  sea.142  143  144  Biodegradable  bioplastics  are
readily  mixed  with  non-biodegradable  bioplastics  and
conventional  plastics,  and  enter  the  current  plastic
recycling processes where they can lower  the  quality  of
recycled materials.145 146

Using  readily  biodegradable  materials  to  package  food
items may also be a part of the transition from single-use
plastics if effective biodegradable waste collection existed

at  a  national  scale,  beginning  with  major  U.S  cities.
Unfortunately, this is currently not available.

Although  new  technologies  and  alternative  materials
are  under  development  to  derive  plastic  from  materials
such  as  algae,  methane,  or  seaweed,147  the  majority
of  bioplastics  are  currently  made  from  agricultural
crops.148 In 2018, more than half of global production of
bioplastics  occurred  in  Asia.149  Production  impacts  of
bio-based  plastics  can  include  threatened  biodiversity
and food security, degraded water quality, land conflicts,
and  increased  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  land
use  change.150  Paper  is  not  a  more  responsible  option.
Consumption  of  paper-based  packaging  is  increasing151
and  the  pulp  industry  is  booming,  which  is  impacting
already-limited  forest  resources.152  Thus,  there  is  a  risk
that an increased demand for paper or bio-based plastics
for  packaging  or  other  single-use  applications  would
exacerbate these negative impacts.

COMPANIES EVALUATED AND METHODOLOGY

This  report  is  the  first  of  its  kind  to  evaluate  the
overall  plastic  footprints  of  major  U.S.  retailers,  and
whether  they  are  adequately  responding  to  this  global
crisis.  In  many  respects,  it  serves  as  a  baseline  for
measuring  future  reforms.  Greenpeace  evaluated  20
U.S.  retailersxxvii  in  four  key  areas:  policy,  reduction,
innovation  and
initiatives,  and  transparency.  Each
company  received  an  identical  survey  reflective  of  the
four  scoring  criteria,  along  with  advance  notice  of  the
survey  and  context  about  this  assessment,  and  was
given  approximately  seven  weeks  to  complete  it.  ALDI,
Kroger,  Albertsons,  Trader  Joe’s,  Sprouts,  Walmart,
Hy-Vee, Target, Southeastern Grocers, and Giant Eagle
fully  participated  in  the  survey  process.  Costco,  Whole
Foods,  and  The  Save  Mart  Companies  provided  some
additional
information.  Wegmans,  Ahold  Delhaize,
Publix,  WinCo  Foods,  Meijer,  Wakefern,  and  H-E-B  did
not participate in the survey process.

Scoring Criteria

Policy:  The  policy  score  evaluates  a  retailer’s  standards
to  mitigate  its  plastic  footprint  and  transition  to  more
sustainable  product  delivery  systems.  To  lead  in  this
category,  a  retailer  would  have  a  comprehensive  public
policy  with
(e.g.,
supplier  requirements,  absolute  reduction  targets,  no
problematic or non-recyclable packaging).

rigorous,  enforceable  standards

Reduction:  The  reduction  score  evaluates  whether  a
retailer  has  a  time-bound  commitment  to  reduce—and
ultimately  phase  out—single-use  plastics.  To  lead  in
this  category,  a  retailer  would  have  a  comprehensive
public  commitment  to  reduce  its  total  number  of  units
packaged in single-use plastics.

Innovation and Initiatives: This score evaluates whether
a  retailer  is  implementing  alternatives  to  single-use
plastics,  supporting  plastic  reduction  initiatives,  and
engaging  multiple  stakeholders  to  develop  solutions.
To
in  this  category,  a  retailer  would  deliver
scalable  solutions  in  collaboration  with  its  own  brand
and  national  brand  suppliers,  and  not  simply  replace
one  single-use  material  for  another  or  merely  use
greenwashing to continue business as usual.

lead

Greenpeace  also  used  publicly  available  information
(e.g.,  websites,  annual  reports,
industry  press)  to
evaluate companies.xxviii  While some profiled companies
may  have  internal  initiatives,  Greenpeace  is  unable  to
assess initiatives for which it has no data.

Surveys  were  scored  independently  and  consistently.
After  extensive  review  of  independent  findings  among
the  scoring  team,  companies  received  a  score  for  each
criterion and an overall score (a weighted average of all
four  criteria).  Each  company  profile  features  its  score
for  each  of  the  four  criteria  and  its  overall  score  (on  a
100-point  scale).  Retailers  are  ranked  based  on  their
overall  score,  where  below  40  is  failing  (red),  40  to  69.9
is passing (yellow), and above 70 is leading (green). Each
company  is  encouraged  to  meet  with  Greenpeace  to
discuss its results and Greenpeace’s recommendations.

Transparency: The transparency score evaluates whether
a  retailer  publicly  communicates
its  policies  and
initiatives  and  whether  it  makes  comprehensive  data
available  regarding  its  single-use  plastic  footprint.  To
lead in this category, a retailer would communicate about
its initiatives, publicly report its annual plastic footprint
(e.g.,  number,  weight,  and  types  of  plastics  used),
and  include  progress  toward  reduction  goals,  not  just
progress on recycling or recyclability.

xxvii While several profiled companies have international operations (e.g., Walmart, Costco, Ahold Delhaize), this report evaluates U.S. operations only, including how a retailer applies its
single-use plastic policies across its brick-and-mortar (this includes convenience stores) and online operations.
xxviii For a majority of retailers, the information on stores, banners, and revenue is primarily based on data available in the Supermarket News “Top 75 Retailers & Wholesalers” report. See

Headquarters: Batavia, IL

Stores and Banners: 1,864 stores operating as ALDI

Background: ALDI US (“ALDI”) is a rapidly expanding discount
chain  that  sells  mostly  private  label  products,  and  is  owned
by German parent company ALDI Süd. Its FY 2018 revenue was
$18.43 billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  ALDI  is  the  top-ranked  retailer  in
Greenpeace’s  first  evaluation  of  U.S.  retailers  on  single-use
plastics.  While  ALDI  still  failed,  it  appears  headed  in  the  right
direction. ALDI is one of three profiled retailers with a specific
public  reduction  target  and  one  of  only  two  profiled  retailers
to  receive  a  passing  score  in  the  transparency  category.
Greenpeace looks forward to working with ALDI in reducing its
reliance on single-use plastics in light of its recent momentum
and openness to collaboration.

Policy: ALDI aims by 2025 to reduce its private label packaging
material by 15% (by sales weight) as well as use 100% reusable,
recyclable,  or  compostable  packaging  for  its  private  label
products.154  While  it  is  promising  that  ALDI  has  a  specific
reduction  target,  the  downside  is  that  this  goal  includes
relative  reductions  (i.e.,  lightweighting)  instead  of  actually
reducing the number of items with plastic packaging by a full
15%.  Greenpeace  urges  ALDI  to  update  its  commitment  to
include  absolute  reduction  targets  that  lead  to  a  complete
phase-out of single-use plastics.

Reduction: By virtue of not operating any in-store cafés, delis,
or  food  or  salad  bars,  ALDI  avoids  distributing  single-use
plastic foodware. The retailer does not sell plastic straws, and
it is currently evaluating how to reduce straws and other single-
use plastics in its beverage and baked goods categories. ALDI
has  never  provided  any  lightweight  single-use  plastic  bags  at
checkout. Unfortunately, the retailer still has plastic checkout
bags  available  for  purchase.xxix  ALDI  must  join  retailers  like
Whole Foods that stopped offering plastic checkout bags years
ago.

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Because  ALDI  is  a  vertically
integrated  company  with  more  than  90%  private
label
products,155  it  has  the  opportunity  to  swiftly  shift  to  less
wasteful  and  more
innovative  reuse  and  refill  systems
when  compared  with  most  other  retailers.  ALDI  has  publicly
committed to implement a project by 2020 that makes it easier
for customers to reuse its private label product packaging. The
retailer  has  created  a  “Packaging  Working  Group  to  enhance
internal  exchange”  between  its  CSR  and  buying  teams.156
While  the  efficacy  of  this  internal  initiative  is  unknown,  its
presence,  along  with  ALDI’s  International  Position  Statement
on Sustainable Product Packaging,157 suggests that the retailer
is beginning to take this issue seriously. ALDI is also an active
member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition.

Transparency:  ALDI  tied  Sprouts  as  the  highest-performing
retailer  in  this  category,  largely  because  of  its  high  level  of
transparency  with  Greenpeace  on  its  overall  plastic  footprint.
Like  many  retailers,  ALDI  is  working  to  establish  a  baseline  in
order  to  measure  progress  toward  its  commitments.  While
ALDI will provide updates on its progress toward its 2025 goals,
it must go much further. ALDI and all U.S. retailers need to be
significantly  more  transparent  with  the  public  about  their
overall plastic footprints.

xxix While these heavier plastic bags are designed to be reused and can be recycled, it does not mean they will be.

Baker’s, Gerbes, Harris Teeter, Pick ‘n Save, Copps, Metro Market,

Background:  The  Kroger  Co.  (“Kroger”)  is  the  second-largest
U.S.  retailer,  behind  Walmart.  Kroger’s  FY  2018  revenue  (for
consumables) was $117.15 billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  Kroger  is  the  only  U.S.  retailer  of
its  size  that  has  committed  to  phase  out  single-use  plastic
checkout  bags  (although  not  until  2025),  and  its  recent
partnership with Loop is encouraging. However, given its size
and influence on its supply chain, Kroger must take markedly
greater  action  to  reduce  its  enormous  plastic  footprint,
including  implementing  reuse  and  refill  systems  nationwide.
Bag  bans,  pilots,  and  recycling  alone  will  not  cut  it;  the
second-largest  U.S.  retailer  needs  to  act  boldly  to  address  its
contribution to the plastic pollution crisis.

Policy:  Kroger  has  sustainable  packaging  guidelines  for
its  suppliers  and  a  series  of  2020  goals  for  its  private  label
products,
recycled
content, supporting improved recycling efforts, and providing
customer  education  about  the  recyclability  of  its  products.158
These  initiatives  might  have  been  noteworthy  decades  ago,
but given the sheer size of Kroger’s operations and the scale of
the problem, Kroger must significantly increase its ambition in
order reduce its plastic footprint.

implementation
bags  by  2025,  which,  despite  the  slow
timeline,  makes  it  the  only  retailer  of  its  size  with  such  a
commitment.  Kroger  is  making  progress:  as  of  April  2019,
its  QFC  banner  no  longer  offers  single-use  plastic  checkout
bags.  While  this  commitment  could  ultimately  prevent  the
distribution  of  6  billion  single-use  plastic  bags  across  all
stores  annually,159  it  does  not  address  other  single-use  bags
(e.g.,  produce)  offered  in  stores.  As  Kroger  develops  its  post-
2020  goals,  it  must  announce  more  sweeping  commitments
to  eliminate  other  types  of  single-use  plastics,  and  announce
absolute  reduction  targets  (i.e.,  reducing  the  total  number
of  plastic  packaging  units  in  stores,  not  just  lightweighting
existing units) to reduce its massive plastic footprint.xxxi

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Kroger  is  a  member  of  the
Sustainable  Packaging  Coalition  and  seems  poised  to  share
its lessons learned with relevant stakeholders as it phases out
single-use  plastic  checkout  bags.  Kroger  is  actively  working
with its own brand suppliers to implement its 2020 goals, and,
in  an  encouraging  development,  is  beginning  to  pilot  reuse
and refill with Loop.160 Kroger must implement reuse and refill
systems  nationwide  and  leverage  its  massive  buying  power
with  national  brands.  Kroger  should  build  on  its  initial  work
with Procter & Gamble via Loop to markedly expand its reuse
and refill options nationwide.  These initiatives are the antidote
to the failure of recycling to stave off the plastic pollution crisis
(see page 15).

Transparency: Like several other retailers, Kroger is assessing
its  plastic  footprint  and  will  be  able  to  use  this  information
to  report  on  its  single-use  plastics  goals.  However,  for  such
a  large  retailer,  it  is  troubling  that  Kroger  is  not  currently
reporting publicly on its plastic footprint. Kroger must be more
transparent and not just report on improvements for which the
public has no baseline.

xxx For a complete list of Kroger’s retail operations, visit: www.thekrogerco.com/about-kroger/our-business. Prior to its large 2018 sale of its convenience store business, Kroger operated
many convenience stores nationwide. Retailers must also apply their single-use plastic policies to their convenience store operations.
xxxi Kroger aims to reduce plastic resin used by its own brands by 10 million pounds by 2020; however, because it does not provide more information about its plastic footprint, it is unclear
whether these reductions are because of lightweighting, absolute reductions, or a combination of the two. Given the widespread use of lightweighting among U.S. retailers, it would not be
surprising if Kroger elected to largely take this approach. Lightweighting alone will not solve the plastic pollution crisis (see page 15).

Safeway,  Vons,  Jewel-Osco,  Shaw’s,  ACME  Markets,  Tom
Thumb, Randalls, United Supermarkets, Pavilions, Star Market,
Carrs, and Haggenxxxii

Background:  Albertsons  Companies  (“Albertsons”)  is  the
fourth-largest U.S. retailer by annual sales. Its FY 2018 revenue
was $60.25 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Albertsons is far behind frontrunner
ALDI  and  just  behind  Kroger.  Albertsons  carries  an  enormous
number  of  products  across  its  many  banners  and  brands.
Similar to other large retailers, given its size, it has an increased
responsibility to urgently and dramatically reduce its massive
plastic  footprint.  While  Albertsons  has  a  public  policy  and
commitments on single-use plastics, it fails to include specific
reduction targets or a commitment to transparently report its
plastic footprint.

Policy:  In  April  2019,  Albertsons  joined  the  growing  number
of retailers releasing commitments and plans to tackle single-
use plastics.161 Albertsons’ pledge is similar to the EMF Global
Commitment, begging the question if Albertsons will sign on.
Unfortunately,  Albertsons  missed  its  opportunity  to  match  or
exceed other retailers’ commitments. Albertsons’ commitment
falls  short  of  ALDI’s  because  it  lacks  an  absolute  reduction
target  and,  unlike  Kroger,  does  not  commit  to  phase  out
single-use plastic checkout bags. While Albertsons stated that
supplier compliance is required with the company’s packaging
guidelines,
it  did  not  clarify  what  sort  of  enforcement
mechanisms exist to ensure compliance.

Reduction:  Albertsons  has  initiatives  to  increase  recycled
content  in  some  of  its  private  label  products  and  is  exploring
how to reduce single-use plastic bag use at checkout, though
it  is  failing  on  the  latter  initiative,  especially  when  compared
with  Kroger’s  goal  to  ban  single-use  plastic  checkout  bags.
Albertsons  is  one  of  the  few  profiled  retailers  that  is  working
to  reduce  single-use  plastics  and  plastic  waste  in  seafood
procurement.  While  Albertsons  also  has  initiatives  to  phase
out non-recyclable plastics in some of its in-store foodservice
operations,xxxiii it is unclear how many stores are involved. This
is why Albertsons and other retailers must have comprehensive
data on their plastic footprints.

Initiatives:  Like  ALDI,  Albertsons  has
Innovation  and
companywide  engagement  on  single-use  plastics,  though  its
scope  and  effectiveness  are  unclear.  Albertsons  is  working
with  stakeholders  like  the  Sustainable  Packaging  Coalition
and  with  its  suppliers  to  address  plastic  pollution  across  its
various  brands  and  in  the  produce  category.  Unfortunately,
it  remains  unclear  if  and  how  Albertsons  will  leverage  its
massive  purchasing  power  with  consumer  goods  companies,
like  Unilever,  and  how  it  plans  to  implement  reuse  and  refill
in  the  Hefty  EnergyBag
systems.  Albertsons  participates
Program,  which  leads  to  the  incineration  or  pyrolysis  of  non-
recyclable  plastics  (see  page  8).  Plastic  incineration  in  any
form threatens human health and the climate. Albertsons must
immediately stop participating in this program.

Transparency:  While  Albertsons  has  publicly  committed
to  “decrease  plastic  usage,  with  an  emphasis  on  single-
use  plastics,”162  it  is  unclear  by  how  much  and  whether
it  will  lead  by  setting  absolute  plastic  reduction  targets,
rather  than  lightweighting.  For  such  a  large  retailer,  it  is
troubling that Albertsons is not reporting its plastic footprint.
Albertsons  must  be  more  transparent  and  not  just  report  on
improvements for which the public has no baseline.

xxxii Albertsons also operates convenience stores, which are not included in this figure. Retailers must also apply their single-use plastic policies to their convenience store operations.

Stores and Banners: 496 stores operating as Trader Joe’s

Background: Trader Joe’s is a nationwide chain known for its
unique private label products. Its FY 2018 revenue was $14.12
billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  Trader  Joe’s  appears  to  be  shifting
the  way  it  approaches  plastics,  which,  until  recently,  had
been  little  to  nonexistent.  In  response  to  customer  concerns
and a Greenpeace campaign, Trader Joe’s announced a series
of  single-use  plastic  initiatives  on  the  last  day  of  2018.163
Greenpeace commends Trader Joe’s for starting this important
work. However, the retailer should markedly expand the scope
of  its  commitments,  employ  reuse  and  refill  systems,  and
increase its transparency.

Policy: As with its other sustainability initiatives, in place of a
more detailed policy, Trader Joe’s has shared an update with
the public on its plastic reduction progress so far. The retailer
has  also  informed  its  suppliers  which  types  of  plastics  to
avoid, which is a first step toward a more comprehensive set of
supplier requirements. While it is encouraging that Trader Joe’s
is working to reduce and remove packaging, the retailer must
develop  a  comprehensive,  time-bound  policy  to  reduce  and
ultimately  phase  out  single-use  plastics.  According  to  some
reports, another announcement may be forthcoming.164

Reduction:  As  a  result  of  its  recent  commitments,  Trader
Joe’s  has  stopped  offering  plastic  bags  at  checkout,  and
has  replaced  plastic  bags  in  the  produce  department  with
compostable  alternatives.  The  retailer  is  also  working  to
eliminate  polystyrene  foam  from  all  of  its  products.  By  the
end of 2019, Trader Joe’s expects to have eliminated 1 million
pounds  of  plastic  from  its  stores.  However,  celebrating  this
milestone  is  difficult  without  a  transparent  baseline  detailing
the  retailer’s  overall  plastic  footprint.  Trader  Joe’s  has  a
unique  opportunity  based  on  its  highly  vertically  integrated
supply  chain.  Since  Trader  Joe’s  has  more  direct  control  over
its  expansive  private  label  portfolio,  it  can  and  should  move
swiftly to implement sweeping reforms.

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Trader  Joe’s  acknowledges  that
transitioning  fossil-based  plastics  to  bioplastics  is  not  the
answer,  and  while  its  recent  transition  to  compostable  bags
for  produce  is  a  step  away  from  fossil  fuel-based  materials,  it
is merely substituting one single-use material for another (see
page 16). Trader Joe’s needs to markedly invest in alternative
delivery  systems,  including  reuse  and  refill.  The  retailer  had
bulk  foods  in  its  stores  years  ago.  It  is  time  to  redeploy  this
basic  strategy  and  permit  customers  to  bring  in  their  own
reusable containers.

Transparency: Trader Joe’s is working this year to establish a
baseline, so it can measure progress toward its commitments.
While Trader Joe’s has publicly committed to provide updates
on  its  progress,  it  must  also  be  transparent  with  the  public
about its overall plastic footprint.

Market

Background:  Sprouts  Farmers  Market  (“Sprouts”)  is  a  rapidly
growing  national  retailer,  with  its  highest  concentration  of
stores in California, Texas, and Arizona. Its FY 2018 revenue was
$5.22 billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  Sprouts  performed  poorly  across
most  categories,  indicating  its  low  level  of  ambition  to  date.
However,  it  achieved  a  passing  score  in  the  transparency
category,  which  markedly  increased  its  overall  score.  Sprouts
seems  poised  to  take  a  leadership  role  in  reducing  its  plastic
footprint  and  is  among  the  many  retailers  working  to  release
more  comprehensive  public  plans.  As  it  develops  its  single-
use  plastic  reduction  policy,  Sprouts  has  an  opportunity  to
set an even higher bar than existing commitments from other
retailers.

Policy:  Sprouts  does  not  yet  have  a  public  policy  or
commitment  on  single-use  plastics.  The  retailer  is  building
on  its  existing  initiatives  to  establish  sustainable  packaging
guidelines across its categories, engage suppliers, and develop
reduction targets.

Reduction:  Roughly  half  of  its  stores  (primarily  those  in
California, which has a statewide plastic bag ban) have already
phased  out  single-use  plastic  bags  at  checkout.  If  a  retailer
the size of Kroger can commit to phase out single-use plastic
checkout bags nationwide, Sprouts should easily be able to do
the same. Sprouts has some recycling initiatives, is working to
phase  out  all  non-recyclable  plastics  for  its  own  brands,  and
is  exploring  compostable  alternatives.  Sprouts  is  one  of  the
few  profiled  retailers  that  reported  working  to  reduce  single-
use  plastics  and  plastic  waste  in  seafood  procurement.  The
retailer must significantly raise its level of ambition by setting
absolute  reduction  targets  and  avoiding  distractions  such  as
lightweighting and material substitution (see page 16).

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Sprouts  is  engaging  its  suppliers
and  experts  to  develop  a  more  robust  strategy.  The  retailer
provides some reuse and refill options in stores (e.g., reusable
produce  and  bulk  bags,  milk  bottle  take-back  program,  and,
in  some  stores,  bulk  honey,  vinegar,  and  oil).  Sprouts  should
ensure its private label and national brand suppliers, like Coca-
Cola,  shift  to  reuse  and  refill  systems  that  altogether  avoid
single-use plastics or any other single-use materials.

Transparency:  Sprouts  was  tied  with  ALDI  as  the  highest-
performing retailer in this category, largely because of its high
level  of  transparency  with  Greenpeace  on  its  overall  plastic
footprint.  Greenpeace  urges  Sprouts  to  publicly  share  its
plastic  footprint,  and  to  provide  updates  on  its  progress  to
reduce its reliance on single-use plastics (see page 12).

Stores  and  Banners:  5,764  stores  operating  as  Walmart,
Walmart  Supercenter,  Neighborhood  Market,  and  Sam’s
Clubxxxiv

Background:  Walmart  is  the  largest  U.S.  retailer.  Its  FY  2018
revenue (for consumables) was $270.12 billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  Walmart  came  in  sixth  place,  and
its score is nothing to celebrate. But if Walmart were ready to
lead, things would dramatically change. It is hard to overstate
the power that Walmart has in retail: Walmart can use its size
and  influence  to  shape  future  trends,  for  the  benefit  or  ill  of
society.  For  example,  if  Walmart  required  major  brands  like
Nestlé to shift to reuse and refill systems to qualify to be sold in
its stores, these companies would immediately do so to remain
relevant. Walmart can and must take bolder action to reverse
the  current  trajectory  of  turning  our  planet  into  a  hazardous
plastic dumpsite.

Policy:  Walmart  does  not  have  a  comprehensive  single-use
plastic  reduction  policy.  Walmart  is  a  signatory  of  the  EMF
Global Commitment; however, it remains unclear how Walmart
will operationalize its pledge to the commitment. While it has
various  goals  and  commitments,  a  Sustainable  Packaging
Playbook,165  and  a  Recycling  Playbook  for  suppliers,166    it  is
unclear  whether  Walmart  ensures  supplier  compliance.  While
far  from  the  impactful  public  commitments  a  retailer  of  its
size should have, Walmart Canada has set a higher bar than its
U.S. counterpart.167 Walmart U.S. must move beyond recycling
and  create  a  time-bound  policy  based  on  absolute  reduction
targets and reuse and refill systems.

Reduction:  It  is  troubling  that  the  largest  U.S.  retailer  is
currently doing so little to reduce its plastic footprint. Walmart
has  “an  ambitious  2025  recycled  content  target”168  and  plans
to eliminate PVC and polystyrene in its own brands by 2025 as
well.  However,  its  “ambitious”  goal  of  20%  recycled  content
and protracted six-year implementation timeline are painfully
inadequate.  Unlike  Kroger,  Walmart  seems  determined  to
keep plastic bags at checkout. In response to a ban on single-
use  plastic  bags  in  Charleston,  South  Carolina,  a  local  paper
noted  that  Walmart  “has  beefed  up  its  giveaway  plastic  bags
to  make  them  reusable  and  emblazoned  them  with  feel-
good  messages.  But  let’s  face  it:  plastic  is  plastic.”169  Walmart
must  commit  to  ambitious  reduction  targets  coupled  with
alternative product delivery models to single-use packaging.

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Walmart  is  a  member  of  the
Sustainable  Packaging  Coalition  and  the  Trash  Free  Seas
Alliance.  Walmart  appears  to  be  open  to  collaborating

materials  with  reusable  packaging  containers  (RPCs).xxxv  This
suggests that it will reform how goods are transported to retail
stores, but it is unclear how. Part of Walmart’s global strategy
to  address  plastics  in  its  supply  chain  is  to  “engage  with
innovators  to  help  support  development  of  environmentally
preferable  options  to  plastics  and  promote  reuse.…”170
Greenpeace urges Walmart to follow through on this strategy,
engage  large  national  brands  like  Nestlé,  and  significantly
expand its implementation of reuse and refill systems.

collecting  data  on  its  plastic  footprint.  While  Walmart  will
report publicly on its progress toward its goals, it is unclear if
the  retailer  will  report  on  its  overall  footprint.  Especially  as  a
signatory of the EMF Global Commitment, it is time for Walmart
and  other  retailers  to  own  up  to  their  massive  contribution
to  the  plastic  pollution  crisis—and  that
includes  being
transparent with the public.

xxxiv Walmart also operates convenience stores. Retailers must also apply their single-use plastic policies to their convenience store operations.
xxxv When Walmart suppliers switched to RPCs to deliver eggs, 37 million eggs were prevented from being thrown out because of breakage in the first year of implementation alone. This is
just one instance where elimination of single-use plastics can reduce food waste. See Walmart’s Sustainable Packaging Playbook.

Stores  and  Banners:  255  stores  operating  as  Hy-Vee,  Hy-Vee
Drugstore,  Fast  &  Fresh,  Mainstreet,  HealthMarket,  and
DollarFreshxxxvi

Background:  Hy-Vee  is  an  employee-owned  company  with
stores  located  in  the  Midwest.  Its  FY  2018  revenue  was  $10.2
billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  Hy-Vee  has  performed  well
in
Greenpeace  seafood  sustainability  evaluations,  but  when
it  comes  to  single-use  plastics  it  must  significantly  increase
the  scale  and  impact  of  its  initiatives.  Hy-Vee  is  one  of  the
few  retailers  in  the  top  10  without  a  public  single-use  plastic
commitment.  Fortunately,  Hy-Vee  appears  to  recognize  the
problems  with  single-use  plastics  and  is  developing  a  more
ambitious  strategy  to  reduce,  and  hopefully  phase  out,  its
reliance on single-use plastics.

Policy: Hy-Vee does not have a public policy or commitments
to reduce its plastic footprint; however, it has indicated that it
is  developing  a  more  comprehensive  policy.  Because  far  too
many  commitments  from  other  retailers  are  misguided  (e.g.,
lightweighting,  focusing  mainly  on  recycling,  swapping  one
throwaway  material  for  another),  Hy-Vee  has  the  opportunity
to  announce  a  bold,  absolute  reduction  target  that  could  set
the bar for U.S. retail.

Reduction:  Hy-Vee  is  working  to  replace  many  single-use
plastic  items  with  compostable  alternatives,xxxvii  and  it  has
recently  replaced  plastic  to-go  containers  in  its  foodservice
operations with a compostable alternative. While none of these
initiatives  is  insignificant,  Greenpeace  cautions  Hy-Vee  from
swapping one single-use material to another (see page 16). To
date,  the  retailer’s  efforts  have  largely  focused  on  recycling,
which is not a viable solution, particularly when so little plastic
is  actually  recycled  in  most  U.S.  municipal  systems  (see  page
15).  Hy-Vee  is  working  with  suppliers  to  reduce  or  eliminate
non-recyclable  plastic  packaging.  Hy-Vee  must  engage  its
private  label  and  national  brand  suppliers,  like  Coca-Cola,
to phase out single-use plastics and switch to reuse and refill
systems.

Innovation and Initiatives: Hy-Vee was one of the few retailers
that reported working to mitigate agriwaste from its suppliers’
farms.  Unfortunately,  in  response  to  an  Omaha  proposal  to
ban  plastic  bags  at  grocery  stores,  Hy-Vee  neither  supported
nor  opposed  the  initiative,  stating  only  that  it  promotes
reusable  bags  and  encourages  plastic  bag  recycling  at  its
stores.171 Hy-Vee participates in the Hefty EnergyBag Program,
which  leads  to  the  incineration  or  pyrolysis  of  non-recyclable
plastics (see page 8). Plastic incineration in any form threatens
human health and the climate. Hy-Vee must immediately stop
participating in this program.

Transparency: While Hy-Vee plans to provide annual updates
on  the  amount  of  plastics  that  it  removes  from  its  stores,
it  is  unclear  if  the  retailer  will  also  be  transparent  about  its
overall  plastic  footprint.  As  Hy-Vee  and  other  retailers  assess
their  plastic  footprints,  they  must  markedly  increase  their
transparency;  otherwise,  future  reforms  will  be  difficult  to
assess.

xxxvi Hy-Vee also operates convenience stores, including at its Hy-Vee Gas locations. Retailers must also apply their single-use plastic policies to their convenience store operations.

Headquarters: Minneapolis, MN

Stores and Banners: 1,850 stores operating as Target

Background:  Target  is  the  seventh-largest  U.S.  retailer  based
on revenue. Its FY 2018 revenue (for consumables) was $32.43
billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Target’s performance in this assessment
is dismal, particularly given its size. While Target is one of the
few U.S. retailers to sign on to the EMF Global Commitment, it
remains  unclear  whether  the  retailer  will  set  a  specific,  time-
bound single-use plastic reduction target or if it is simply going
to switch from one throwaway material to another. Target must
leverage  its  brand  and  purchasing  power  with  its  suppliers,
including  Nestlé,  to  prioritize  the  reduction  of  single-use
plastics, as well as implement reuse and refill systems.

Policy:  As  many  other  retailers  publicly  announce  their
commitments and plans to tackle single-use plastics, Target’s
current  plan  (and  its  progress  on  its  2017  commitments)
is  buried  in  its  CSR  website.172  To  date,  it  remains  unclear
how  Target  will  operationalize  its  pledge  to  the  EMF  Global
Commitment.  To  address  the  flood  of  single-use  plastic
checkout  bags  in  Target  stores,  a  customer  started  an  online
petition  in  April  2019  for  Target  to  eliminate  these  bags;  as
of  this  writing,  more  than  300,000  people  have  signed  the
petition. 173

Reduction:  Target  has  a  commitment  to  eliminate  expanded
polystyrene from its own brand packaging by 2022. The retailer
has  switched  to  reusable  foodware  at  its  corporate  office  but
has yet to implement this common-sense reuse system across
its  in-store  cafés.  Target  is  working  to  expand  recycling  and
drive  demand  for  post-consumer  recycled  content;  however,
when only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled,
it is time to consider a new strategy (see page 15). Target needs
a  specific,  absolute  reduction  target  to  bolster  its  current
commitments on single-use plastics.

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Target  is  a  member  of  the
Sustainable Packaging Coalition and the Bioplastic Feedstock
Alliance,  which  explores  the  potential  of  bio-based  products.
However, not all bio-based alternatives to fossil-based plastics
are  the  same,  and  fundamental  problems  will  remain  in  a
single-use  throwaway  model  (see  page  16).  Target  works
with  suppliers  to  provide  sustainable  packaging  guidance;
however,  it  is  unclear  how  Target  is  engaging  its  private  label
and national brand suppliers, like Nestlé, to phase out single-
use  plastics  and  switch  to  reuse  and  refill  systems.  Target
participates  in  the  Hefty  EnergyBag  Program,  which  leads
to  the  incineration  or  pyrolysis  of  non-recyclable  plastics
(see  page  8).  Plastic  incineration  in  any  form  threatens
human health and the climate. Target must immediately stop
participating in this program.

Transparency:  Time  will  determine  whether  Target  achieves
the  goals  outlined  in  the  EMF  Global  Commitment  by  2025.
However,  it  is  unclear  by  how  much  and  whether  it  will  lead
by  setting  absolute  plastic  reduction  targets.  Focusing  on
distractions like bioplastics or lightweighting will not solve the
plastic pollution crisis. For such a large retailer, it is troubling
that  Target  is  not  reporting  its  plastic  footprint.  Target  must
be more transparent, and not just report on improvements for
which the public has no baseline.

Headquarters: Issaquah, WA

Stores and Banners: 627 stores operating as Costco

Background:  Costco  is  the  third-largest  U.S.  retailer  by
largest  membership  warehouse  club
revenue,  and  the
nationwide. Its FY 2018 revenue (for consumables) was $72.15
billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  While  it  is  working  to  eliminate  the
worst  forms  of  plastic  packaging,  Costco  fails  to  demonstrate
publicly  how  it  will  measurably  reduce  its  overall  plastic
footprint  and  implement  reuse  and  refill  systems.  This  is  a
problem  and  a  squandered  opportunity.  Costco  is  so  large
that it could significantly reform product delivery for national
brands  and  its  expansive  private  label,  thereby  creating
positive ripple effects in the retail and consumer goods sectors.
Greenpeace is cautiously optimistic that Costco will release an
updated policy in the future; this is an opportunity to outshine
rivals like Walmart.

Policy:  Costco  does  not  have  a  time-bound  policy  with
absolute  reduction  targets  (i.e.,  reducing  the  total  number
of  plastic  units,  not  just  lightweighting)  to  ultimately  end  its
reliance  on  single-use  plastics.  Instead,  the  retailer  mostly
has  generalized  aspirations  to  increase  the  recyclability  of  its
packaging via material substitution and consumer labeling.174
However,  change  may  be  coming.  Costco  is  considering
improvements
its  single-use  plastic  strategies  and
implementing new policies.

in

Reduction:  Costco  has  some  initiatives  to  replace  expanded
polystyrene with recyclable or compostable fiber. The retailer
has never provided checkout bags. Instead, Costco customers
can  use  the  same  boxes  that  products  were  shipped  in  to
stores.  Costco  is  working  to  replace  single-use  plastics  with
compostable  options  in  its  in-store  cafés.  While  Costco  is
actively  transitioning  away  from  the  least  recyclable  forms
of  plastic  packaging  to  other  forms  that  are  more  recyclable
(or to paper-based packaging),175 this misses the larger point:
retailers  should  not  simply  replace  one  throwaway  material
with another (see page 16).

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Costco
is  a  member  of  the
Sustainable  Packaging  Coalition  and  has  global  packaging
guidelines.  Costco  must  leverage  its  purchasing  power  and
focus on its private label to fundamentally shift how its products
are delivered to customers. Costco should be investing in reuse
and  refill  systems;  however,  it  remains  unclear  to  what  degree
Costco  is  engaging  its  suppliers  in  these  initiatives,  including
national brands like PepsiCo. In 2018, Costco sent 21,914 tons of
trash  in  the  U.S  to  “waste-to-energy”  facilities.176  177  “Waste-to-
energy”  is  often  greenwashing  for  incineration  of  trash,  where
facilities burn a range of materials, including plastics, to produce
energy.  Plastic  incineration  in  any  form  threatens  human
health and the climate (see page 7). Costco should disclose the
specific method(s) of “waste-to-energy” that it employs. If it is
incineration, Costco should abolish this dangerous practice.

Transparency: Costco is not transparent with its overall plastic
footprint,  and  its  aspirations  on  its  sustainability  website
do  not  feature  any  reduction  targets  or  timelines.  As  Costco
launches new policies, it has the opportunity to communicate
them  online,  in  stores,  and  in  the  press.  Additionally,  Costco
should  be  much  more  transparent  with  its  progress  toward
meeting its existing and future goals.

Headquarters: Rochester, NY

Stores and Banners: 98 stores operating as Wegmans

Background:  Wegmans  is  a  family-owned  and  -operated
retailer  operating  in  the  U.S.  Northeast  and  Mid-Atlantic
regions. Its FY 2018 revenue was $9 billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  Wegmans  performed  poorly  in  this
assessment.  While  it  features  some  “sustainable  packaging”
initiatives  on  its  sustainability  website,  and  recently  released
new  plastic  reduction  targets,  Wegmans’  commitments  fall
short.  Our  planet  is  far  past  the  point  where  recyclability,
lightweighting,  and  material  substitution  are  anywhere  near
what is required to tackle the plastic pollution crisis.

Policy:  Wegmans  does  not  have  a  comprehensive  public
policy  seeking  to  phase  out  single-use  plastics.  In  April  2019,
Wegmans  committed  to  reduce  its  in-store  plastic  packaging
from fossil fuels by 2 million pounds in 2019 and by 10 million
pounds  by  2024,178  making  Wegmans  one  of  the  few  retailers
to  actually  set  a  reduction  target.  If  this  were  an  absolute
reduction  target  to  ultimately  end  its  reliance  on  single-use
plastics,  Wegmans’  commitment  would  be  industry-leading.
Unfortunately,  Wegmans  will  attain  this  goal  “to  a  large
extent”179  through material substitution, which is problematic,
as this approach usually shifts ecological harms from one area
to another (see page 16).

Reduction:  Wegmans  has  replaced  a  variety  of  single-use
plastics (e.g., polystyrene foam and PVC,xxxviii where alternatives
exist,  produce  and  bulk  food  bags,  coffee  stir  sticks,  plastic
straws).  The  retailer  claims  that  since  2016,  it  has  “avoided
the  use  of  more  than  6  million  pounds  of  virgin  fossil-based
plastic  [...]  by  increasing  the  use  of  renewable  plant-based
material, mineral fillers, and post-consumer recycled plastic in
[its]  packaging.”180  While  increasing  the  use  of  post-consumer
recycled  plastic  is  a  modest  step  in  the  right  direction,
swapping  one  throwaway  material  for  another  is  not  a  long-
term  sustainable  solution.  What  the  world  really  needs  is  a
mass  reduction  of  fossil-based  and  bio-based  plastics,  not
shifts  that  merely  reallocate  problems  (see  page  16).  And
despite  Wegmans’  media  fanfare  about  removing  single-use
plastic  checkout  bags  from  its  New  York  stores  (it  is  merely
removing bags before the 2020 state law goes into effect), there
is no indication that it will remove plastic checkout bags at its
stores in other states.

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Wegmans  states  that  it  has
a  unique  partnership  with  the  Rochester
Institute  of
Technology’s  Center  for  Sustainable  Packaging  and  American
Packaging  Corporation,  but  there  is  no  indication  that  this
partnership  prioritizes  absolute  reduction  targets.  Wegmans
has  not  publicly  communicated  whether  it  is  investing  in
alternative delivery systems like reuse and refill, nor how it is
engaging  its  private  label  and  national  brand  suppliers,  like
Unilever, to launch these initiatives.

Transparency:  Wegmans’  various  claims  about  overall
reductions  cannot  be  verified,  since  it  does  not  provide  any
information on its overall plastic footprint.

xxxviii Interestingly, on Wegmans’ sustainable packaging website, there is no update regarding the retailer’s 2017 commitment to avoid PVC “where possible and where alternatives exist.”
Also, this statement creates a loophole for continued use of PVC. See Wegmans. “Sustainable Packaging: When Less Is More at Wegmans.” 13 Apr. 2017, www.wegmans.com/news-media/

Background: Whole Foods, known for its natural and organic
products,  accounted  for  60%  of  Amazon’s  consumables
revenue—$16.86  billion  in  FY  2018.  For  the  purposes  of  this
report, Greenpeace evaluated Whole Foods’ operations.xxxix

Greenpeace  Comments:  Given  Whole  Foods’  reputation
as  being  more  ecologically  aware  than  other  retailers,  and
its  solid  performance  in  Greenpeace  seafood  sustainability
evaluations,  it  is  inexcusable  that  the  retailer  is  so  far  behind
on  single-use  plastics.  While  Whole  Foods  may  have  more
ambitious  internal  initiatives,  Greenpeace  is  unable  to  assess
those initiatives given the limited information it received from
the  retailer.  Unfortunately,  Whole  Foods  appears  to  be  stuck
in  the  1990s,  as  many  of  its  initiatives  include  lightweighting
packaging  and  increasing  the  post-consumer  recycled  plastic
content in some of its single-use plastic items.

Policy:  Whole  Foods  does  not  have  a  comprehensive  public
policy  to  addresses  single-use  plastic  waste  generated  by  its
operations. Instead, it has mostly worked on initiatives that do
little  to  address  its  large  plastic  footprint.  While  Whole  Foods
will likely release a more comprehensive policy, the questions
are  when  and  how  ambitious  it  will  it  be.  Greenpeace  urges
Whole  Foods  to  pursue  a  policy  that  requires  year-over-year
absolute  reductions  in  single-use  plastics  and  to  incorporate
reuse and refill strategies.

it  will  remove  plastic  straws

Reduction: Whole Foods stopped providing single-use plastic
checkout  bags  in  2008.  The  retailer  banned  microbeads  in
its  products  before  national  law  took  effect,  and  recently
announced
its  stores
nationwide. Whole Foods has focused on some lightweighting
(e.g.,  produce  bags,  rotisserie  chicken  packaging)  and
increasing recycled content in some items. While Whole Foods
has adopted plastic waste mitigation measures ahead of most
other  retailers,  even  with  its  recent  straws  announcement,  it
has  so  far  failed  to  take  bold  action  commensurate  with  the
urgency of the plastic pollution crisis.

in

Innovation and Initiatives: Apart from standard bulk sections
(e.g.,  dried  foods,  coffee),  Whole  Foods  does  not  have  any
innovative  systems  regarding  reuse  and  refill.  Whole  Foods
should  engage  its  private  label  and  national  brand  suppliers,
like  Danone,  to  develop  and  implement  reuse  and  refill
systems.

Transparency:  In  2008,  when  Whole  Foods  made  headlines
for  its  single-use  plastic  checkout  bag  ban,  it  also  had
extensive blogs discussing its plastic initiatives, and even had
a Responsible Packaging Task Force.181 However, aside from its
recent  straws  announcement,  Whole  Foods  has  largely  been
quiet on its website regarding single-use plastics. Whole Foods
did not provide any information on its overall plastic footprint,
and it is unclear if it will do so in the future. This is unfortunate,
and does not bode well when seeking to measure the impact of
any possible future reforms.

xxxix Amazon’s FY 2018 consumable sales were $28.1 billion. Whole Foods’ brick-and-mortar stores account for $16.86 billion of these sales. Amazon also plans to dramatically increase the
footprint of its Amazon Go cashierless convenience stores. As Amazon’s market share in brick-and-mortar and online consumables grows, it has an increased responsibility to address its
plastics footprint.

Background:  The  Save  Mart  Companies
(“Save  Mart”)
operates  stores in California and Nevada. Its FY 2018  revenue
was $4 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Save Mart missed the mark on single-
use  plastics.  While  Save  Mart  has  some  initiatives  under  way,
it  lacks  a  comprehensive  strategy  or  policy  to  substantially
reduce  and  ultimately  phase  out  single-use  plastics.  While
the retailer appears open to working on this issue, it remains
unclear to what degree and how quickly Save Mart will act and
whether it will engage its supply chain to make much-needed
reforms.

Policy:  Save  Mart  does  not  have  a  comprehensive  public
policy to reduce and ultimately phase out single-use plastics.
In  addition  to  aligning  internal  resources  to  develop  a  policy,
Save  Mart,  like  every  retailer,  should  be  gathering  data  from
suppliers  in  order  to  establish  a  single-use  plastics  baseline,
and  then  create  a  policy  based  on  absolute  plastic  reduction
targets (i.e., reducing the total number of plastic units, not just
lightweighting).

Reduction: Save Mart does not offer plastic bags at checkout in
96% of its stores, largely because most of its stores are located
in  California.  Save  Mart  should  make  this  a  companywide
policy,  so  its  Nevada  stores  (the  remaining  4%)  would  no
longer  distribute  single-use  plastic  checkout  bags.  Save
Mart’s  plastic  reduction  initiatives  focus  largely  on  recycling
or  switching  from  one  kind  of  single-use  material  to  another
(see  page  16).  Save  Mart  has  removed  polystyrene  from  its
meat and deli departments in some stores. The retailer should
remove polystyrene from all of its stores, and engage its private
label  and  national  brand  suppliers,  like  Procter  &  Gamble,
to  reduce  single-use  plastics  and  invest  in  reuse  and  refill
systems.

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Save  Mart  indicated  very  few
innovative  practices.  The  retailer  offers  one  brand  of  milk  that
comes  in  a  glass  container  that  can  be  returned  for  a  bottle
deposit.  Save  Mart  is  also  piloting  a  program  for  bulk  freezer
goods, where customers can use compostable/recyclable boxes.
Save  Mart  should  take  note  of  how  Metro  is  implementing  its
pilot  program  in  Quebec,182  and  identify  how  to  implement  a
similar  program  in  its  stores.  Surely  Save  Mart  can  figure  out
a  way  for  its  customers  to  fill  their  own  containers  while  still
respecting local and statewide regulations.

Transparency:  Like  many  other  retailers,  Save  Mart  needs  to
analyze and report its plastic footprint. This requires engaging
its private label and national brands; there should be no excuse
for  failure  to  do  so.  Data  collection  and  reporting  are  going
to become the norm, as the public and organizations like the
Ellen MacArthur Foundation usher in calls for transparency.

Background:  Ahold  Delhaize  USA  (“Ahold  Delhaize)  is  the
fifth-largest U.S. retailer, and is the largest division of its Dutch-
owned parent company. Its FY 2018 revenue was $44.2 billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  Ahold  Delhaize’s  performance  was
especially  awful  given  its  massive  size.  However,  it  should
improve in the near future, as the retailer has begun to engage
more  deeply  on  this  issue.  Ahold  Delhaize  has  identified
plastics as a key issue through a listening process with a variety
of stakeholders.183 In late 2018, Ahold Delhaize signed on to the
EMF Global Commitment. Going forward, Ahold Delhaize must
“dramatically reduce”xl its massive plastic footprint to counter
its role in the plastic pollution crisis.

Policy:  Ahold  Delhaize  is  one  of  the  few  U.S.  retailers  to  sign
on  to  the  EMF  Global  Commitment.  However,  it  remains
unclear  whether  the  retailer  will  set  specific,  time-bound
single-use plastic reduction targets, or if it will resort to either
lightweighting  its  existing  product  line  or  switching  from  one
throwaway material to another (see page 16).

Reduction:  Publicly,  aside  from  its  purported  numbers  of
single-use  checkout  bags  avoided,184  Ahold  Delhaize  has
nothing  significant  to  offer  for  reduction.  The  retailer  still
provides  single-use  plastic  bags  to  customers  at  checkout.  It
is  unacceptable  for  Ahold  Delhaize  to  continue  churning  out
single-use  plastic  packaged  products  without  any  plans  for
absolute  reductions.  And  focusing  efforts  on  the  recyclability
of plastics is insufficient, especially when U.S. plastics recycling
rates are so low (see page 15).

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Ahold  Delhaize  is  a  member  of
the  Sustainable  Packaging  Coalition.  However,  it  is  unclear
how the retailer is leveraging its buying power with its private
label  and  national  brand  suppliers,  including  behemoths  like
Coca-Cola,xli  to  reduce  its  reliance  on  single-use  plastics  and
transition  to  reuse  and  refill  systems.  The  European  division
of  Ahold  Delhaize  features  “natural  branding”  of  producexlii  in

Transparency:  Time  will  determine  whether  Ahold  Delhaize

Headquarters: Jacksonville, FL

Stores  and  Banners:  552  stores  operating  as  BI-LO,  Harveys
Supermarket, Winn-Dixie, and Fresco y Más

Background:  As  its  name  implies,  Southeastern  Grocers  is
regionally  located  in  the  U.S.  Southeast.  Its  FY  2018  revenue
was $8.35 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Southeastern Grocers’ poor performance
reflects its past initiatives (or lack thereof) to tackle single-use
plastics.  However,  it  seems  that  the  retailer  may  be  prepared
to  more  strategically  engage  on  the  issue.  Southeastern
Grocers exhibited more transparency than all of its peers in the
bottom half of the rankings regarding its plastic footprint. This
is  noteworthy,  because  transparency  is  the  first  step  needed
to  measure  future  reforms.  Greenpeace  remains  cautiously
optimistic  and  prepared  to  engage  Southeastern  Grocers  on
meaningful improvements.

Policy: Southeastern Grocers does not have a comprehensive
public  policy  to  address  its  role  in  the  plastic  pollution  crisis,
and must immediately formulate a plan that addresses both its
private label and national brand products (see page 12).

Reduction: Southeastern Grocers has virtually nothing to show
for  plastic  reduction  in  its  stores.  Like  several  other  retailers,
Southeastern  Grocers  has  a  community  bag  reward  program
that  encourages  recycling  and  charitable  giving  in  local
communities. The impact of this program is not documented.

Innovation and Initiatives: Southeastern Grocers has neither
piloted nor implemented any innovative reuse or refill systems.
As
it  develops  a  comprehensive  program,  Southeastern
Grocers  must  engage  its  private  label  and  national  brand
suppliers,  like  Danone,  to  phase  out  single-use  plastics  and
switch to reuse and refill systems.

Transparency:  While  it  is  still  gathering  data,  Southeastern
Grocers  scored  higher  than  its  peers  in  this  category,  largely
because  of  its  high  level  of  transparency  with  Greenpeace
on  its  overall  plastic  footprint.  Southeastern  Grocers  should
provide  public  updates  regarding  its  plastic  footprint  and
progress on reduction initiatives.

Headquarters: Lakeland, FL

Stores  and  Banners:  1,218  stores  operating  as  Publix,  Publix
Sabor, and GreenWise Market

Background:  Publix  is  the  sixth-largest  retailer  by  revenue,
operating  in  the  U.S.  South,  Southeast,  and  Mid-Atlantic
regions. Its FY 2018 revenue was $36.38 billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  Publix  failed  big  time,  thanks  to  its
almost  singular  focus  on  recycling  and  lack  of  transparency.
While  recycling  has  some  role  to  play,  this  strategy  alone  is
failing  and  will  not  curb  the  tidal  wave  of  plastics  into  our
environment (see page 15). Publix touts a strange assortment
of tepid “achievements” for a retailer of its size: a bags-saved
counter,  removing  plastic  sleeves  from  mops,  and  recycling
4,600 used plastic buckets in its bakeries each week (instead of
finding a way to reduce the number in the first place).185 Publix
has  utterly  failed  to  take  responsibility  for  its  massive  role
in  the  plastic  pollution  crisis,  and  concerned  customers  are
taking note.

Policy:  Publix  does  not  have  a  comprehensive  public  single-use
plastic  reduction  policy.  One  is  left  with  the  impression  that
Publix’s  leadership  is  unaware  that  it  should  immediately
address the thousands upon thousands of its products that are
packaged in single-use plastics.

Reduction:  Perhaps  the  retailer’s  most  noteworthy  reported
achievement is its effort to reduce the amount of polystyrene
foam  used  in  transporting  seafood.xliii  Oddly,  in  the  same
sustainability  report,  Publix  celebrates  saving  on  packaging
tonnage by switching its deli tuna from readily recyclable cans
to  hard-to-recycle  plastic  laminate  pouches.  Publix’s  seafood
team  should  be  concerned  with  this  approach,  as  more  and
more  fish  ingest  microplastics  that  enter  our  food  supply
chains  (see  page  6).  While  Publix  claims  to  have  plastic  bag
reduction goals, it appears to have not trained all staff on these
goals.186  Some  shoppers  have  complained  that  most  cashiers
readily hand out single-use plastic checkout bags, even when
only one item is being purchased.187

Innovation  and  Initiatives:  Publix  is  a  member  of  the
Sustainable Packaging Coalition. Aside from that, Greenpeace
could  find  nothing  noteworthy  or
innovative  about  the
retailer’s  approach  to  reducing  single-use  plastics.  Quite
the  contrary.  In  April,  Publix  was  criticized  by  lawmakers
and  the  public  for  lobbying  against  single-use  plastic  bag
bans in Florida.188 189 Publix must turn a corner: it can start by
leveraging  its  purchasing  power  with  its  private  label  and
national  brand  suppliers,  like  Procter  &  Gamble,  to  phase
out single-use plastics and switch to reuse and refill systems.
These  would  be  initiatives  worth  boasting  about  on  its
sustainability website.

Transparency:  There  is  no  information  on  Publix’s  overall
plastic  footprint  or  any  kind  of  comprehensive  commitments
that  have  a  transparency  or  accountability  component.
Interestingly, the public is offered one tidbit on the amount of
plastic  waste  generated  by  Publix  retail  bakeries:  4,600  high-
density  polyethylene  plastic  buckets  per  week.  Instead  of
reducing this waste or developing a reuse system, the buckets
are sent for recycling.

this  initiative.  While  it  is  encouraging  that  Giant  Eagle  is
considering  the  unintended  consequences  of  this  initiative,
replacing  one  throwaway  material  with  another  is  not  the
solution  (see  page  16).  The  retailer  should  instead  refocus  its
efforts on alternative delivery systems. As Giant Eagle engages
its  private  label  and  national  brand  suppliers  on  plastics,  it
must urge large national brand suppliers, like Nestlé, to phase
out single-use plastics and switch to reuse and refill systems.

Transparency: Giant Eagle did not report on its overall plastic
footprint.  Giant  Eagle  and  other  retailers  must  be  more
transparent, especially as the public is becoming increasingly
concerned about the plastic pollution crisis.

Headquarters: Pittsburgh, PA

Stores and Banners: 216 stores operating as Giant Eagle, Giant
Eagle Express, Market District, and Market District Expressxliv

Background:  Giant  Eagle  is  a  privately  owned,  regional
retailer, with its largest presence in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Its
FY 2018 revenue was $8.9 billion.

Greenpeace  Comments:  Giant  Eagle  has  some  recycling
initiatives  and  small-scale  pilot  programs  to  reduce  single-
use plastics. However, the scale of these pilots is far too small
to  match  the  urgency  and  sheer  size  of  the  plastic  pollution
crisis.  Giant  Eagle  and  other  retailers  must  act  now  as  plastic
continues to flood our environment and enter our food, water,
and air.

Policy:  Giant  Eagle  does  not  have  a  time-bound  policy  with
specific  reduction  targets  to  ultimately  end  its  reliance  on
single-use plastics. This is a significant oversight.

Reduction:  Giant  Eagle’s  ambition  level  in  reducing  single-use
plastics  can  be  best  described  as  timid.  While  the  retailer  is
planning  pilot  programs  and  is  considering  alternatives  to
single-use  plastics  (e.g.,  removing  checkout  bags;  evaluating
compostable alternatives to hot- and cold-food bar packaging,
straws,  cutlery),  its  initiatives  are  lacking  in  both  scale  and
urgency  to  address  the  incessant  flow  of  plastics  into  our
environment.  To  its  credit,  Giant  Eagle  will  be  incentivizing
customers to bring reusable bags through its customer loyalty
program.  Giant  Eagle  is  also  investigating  ways  to  reduce
single-use plastics and plastic waste in seafood procurement.

xliv Giant Eagle also operates 203 GetGo convenience stores and fuel stations and recently acquired 56 Ricker’s locations, which will be rebranded as GetGo. Retailers must also apply their

WinCo does not need Greenpeace to point out this significant

Greenpeace  Comments:  WinCo  is  among  the  lowest-ranked
retailers,  leaving  questions  about  its  focus  on  single-use
plastics and the plastic pollution crisis. Unsurprisingly, there is
no hint of a policy or strategies toward absolute reductions of
single-use plastics. As evidence of its ignorance, it even twisted
the  age-old  adage  of  “reduce,  reuse,  recycle”  into  “recycle,
recycle,  recycle.”xlv  WinCo  could  make  lightning-fast  gains  if
it  seized  the  opportunity  to  convert  its  800-item  bulk  foods
section into a reusable container paradise.

Policy: WinCo does not have a comprehensive public policy or
commitments to reduce its plastic footprint.

Reduction:  Unfortunately,  WinCo  “proudly”  offers  customers
the  option  of  paper  or  single-use  plastic  bags  at  checkout,
unless  it  is  otherwise  prohibited  by  local  law.190  This  pride
is  misplaced.  WinCo  heralds  recycling  as  its  golden  ticket,
stating:  “What  happens  to  the  empty  boxes  and  plastic  wrap
that protect our shipments? Recycle, recycle, recycle.”191 While
recycling  is  not  bad  in  and  of  itself,  having  cheapened  the
phrase “reduce, reuse, recycle” into simply repeating the word
“recycle”  three  times  is  omitting  the  two  far  more  effective
strategies—preventing  unnecessary  waste  from  being  created
in the first place, and investing in reuse. WinCo must recognize
that recycling alone will never solve the plastic pollution crisis
(see page 15).

zero indication that H-E-B’s leadership is aware of the massive
scale of the plastic pollution crisis, growing concerns from the
public,  or  the  inevitable  tide  of  legislation  that  is  sweeping
local and state governing bodies.

Policy: H-E-B does not have a comprehensive public policy or

Reduction:  H-E-B  appears  stuck  in  the  1990s,  focusing  on
recycling  and  beach  cleanups.  H-E-B  failed  to  do  the  right
thing on plastic bags by actually reintroducing them at several

state supreme court ruled a local bag ban to be incompatible

GLOSSARY

Absolute  reduction:  Reducing  the  total  number  of
single-use  plastic  packaging  units,  which  reduces  a
retailer’s  plastic  footprint.  Greenpeace  urges  retailers
to  set  absolute  reduction  targets  to  begin  reducing
and  ultimately  phasing  out  their  reliance  on  single-
use  plastics.  Absolute  reduction  is  more  effective  than
relative reduction (see definition on page 41).

Agriplastics:  Plastic  products  and  packaging  used  in
agricultural  production  and  sales.  Agriplastics  include
mulch  and  greenhouse  film,  silage  covers  and  bags,
irrigation  systems,  tunnels,  and  covers.  Inappropriate
disposal  of  agriplastics  is  common,  with  low  recycling
rates,  and  they  are  often  burned,  abandoned  in  fields
or  watercourses,  buried  in  the  soil,  or  disposed  of  in
landfills. Inappropriate disposal can degrade soil, reduce
crop productivity, and harm marine species if the plastics
enter the ocean.

Bio-based  plastics:  Materials  that  are  partly  or  largely
derived from bio-based feedstocks.

Compostable  plastics:  A  subset  of  biodegradable
plastics  that  biodegrade  within  the  conditions  and
timeframe  of  the  composting  process.  There  is  no
consistently  used  global  standard  for  compostability,
and industrial facilities for handling the materials are not
widely available and accessible to customers.

Ecodesign:  An  approach  to  designing  products  with
special  consideration  for  the  environmental  impacts
of  the  product  during  its  whole  life  cycle.  While  this
approach  offers  some  encouraging  and

Hefty EnergyBag Program: A collaboration among Dow
Chemical,  Keep  America  Beautiful,  Reynolds  Consumer
Products,  and  waste  management  operators  in  select
U.S.  cities.  Well-intentioned  customers  who  receive  or
purchase  these  bags  place  non-recyclable  plastics  into
the Hefty EnergyBag. These plastics are then incinerated
or sent to pyrolysis plants, which convert plastics into a
fossil  fuel  that  is  then  burned.201  The  program  has  been
linked to burning plastics in a Missouri-based cement kiln
that violated the Clean Air Act.202 Burning plastic is known
to release carcinogenic pollutants, which lead to a wide
array of debilitating human health impacts.203 Albertsons,
Target, and Hy-Vee are among retailers that sell the Hefty
EnergyBag.

Lightweighting:  A  design  process  used  to  reduce
the  overall  amount  of  plastics  required  (by  weight)  to
produce packaging, though it does not reduce the number
of  packaging  units  (see  relative  reduction  on  page  41).
Rather  than  lightweighting,  Greenpeace  recommends
a  complete  phase-out  of  single-use  plastic  packaging,
and that retailers focus on reducing the total number of
single-use plastic units (see absolute reduction).

Microfibers:  “[T]iny  fragment[s]  of  the  type  of  plastic
used  to  make  synthetic  fabrics.  These  fibers  are  shed
from synthetic clothing during a washing machine cycle.
Because  they  are  so  small,  microfibers  aren’t  all  caught
by  wastewater  treatment  plants;  instead,  many  are
released into the environment.”204

Microplastics:  Pieces  of  plastic  smaller

Packaging unit: A single packaging container in which a
standard quantity of product will fit (e.g., a single bottle
of  milk  or  water,  a  single  ready-to-eat  meal  tray).  For
example,  a  24-pack  of  bottled  water  would  count  as  24
units.

Relative  reduction:  Reducing  the  amount  of  plastic
used  for  packaging  units  via  lightweighting  or  material
substitution. While this indeed reduces a retailer’s plastic
footprint, it fails to reduce the total number of packaging
units  (see  absolute  reduction  on  page  40).  Greenpeace
urges  retailers  to  move  beyond  these  unambitious
strategies  and  to  set  time-bound  absolute  reduction
targets  that  markedly  reduce  and  ultimately  phase  out
their reliance on single-use plastics.

Reusable packaging: Packaging that has been designed
to  be  refilled  or  used  for  the  same  purpose  within  a
system for reuse.

Single-use  plastic:  Any  plastic  that  is  intended  for  one-
time  use—such  as  plastic  bags,  sachets,  bottles,  and
food, drink, and non-food packaging, designed to be used
only once and then disposed of. This includes recyclable
packaging.

Widely  recyclable:  Plastic  packaging  that  is  accepted  in
residential  curbside  recycling  programs  and  available  to
at least 60% of customers206 in a given location.

Plastic  footprint:  The  total  amount  of  plastic,  by  units
and  weight,  used  or  sold  throughout  a  company’s
operations.

Plastic  sachet:  A  small,  flexible  package  that
is
unrecyclable  and  has  little  or  no  value  to  waste  pickers,
typically  a  laminate  of  plastic  and  another  material,
such  as  foil  containing  a  single  serving  of  a  product.
Sachets  end  up  overwhelming  landfills,  clogging  streets
and  waterways,  and  are  frequently  burned,  emitting
toxins  into  the  air.  Consumer  goods  companies  like
Nestlé,  Unilever,  and  Procter  &  Gamble  produce  and
distribute large numbers of products packaged in sachets,
particularly in Southeast Asia.

Polystyrene:  A  resin  that  has  many  applications,
commonly  as  an  expanded  foam,  such  as  that  found
in  take-out  food  containers.  What  is  commonly  called
Styrofoam  is  actually  a  trademarked  product  frequently
used in building materials.

Primary packaging: Packaging that contains the finished
or  final  products,  also  referred  to  as  retail  or  consumer
packaging.  It  includes  all  packaging  at  the  point  of  sale
that  is  ultimately  disposed  of  by  the  end  user  via  reuse,
