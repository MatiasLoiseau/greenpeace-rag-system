Updated March 2, 2017

Liberated from a confined set of buttons and keyboards, the 
software powering smartphones suddenly gave our phones completely different functionality or could change languages 
without any change to the hardware. Separate devices for 
email, music, and photography are now morphed into a single platform. As wireless data has jumped to broadband speeds in many countries we can get work done on the go, 
find our way around almost anywhere instantaneously, and 
stay in touch with loved ones 24/7, no matter where they are.
In 2007, almost no one owned a smartphone. In 2017, they 
are seemingly everywhere. Globally, among people aged 18-
35, nearly 2 in every 3 people own a smartphone.
1  
In just 10 years, more than 7 billion smartphones have 
been produced.
But as smartphones have spread across the world, the 
rapid churn of devices that is fueling record profits across the technology sector is also causing an ever-widening impact on the planet and the countries where these devices are manufactured. Despite tremendous innovation in the 
functionality of the phones themselves, product design and 
supply chain decisions continue to suffer from the same not-so-smart linear manufacturing model and short-term, profit-driven perspective that have plagued the IT sector for years: 
• Miners in remote landscapes conduct the life-threatening 
work of extracting precious metals for these devices; often fueling armed conflict in countries like the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and leaving the land destroyed;
• Workers in electronics factories are unknowingly exposed 
to hazardous chemicals that damage their health;
• Increasing device complexity means greater amounts of energy is required to produce each phone,
2 which in turns 
increases demand for coal and other forms of dirty energy in China and other parts of Asia;
• Insufficient product take-back and reuse of materials further contributes to a rapidly growing e-waste stream.All this for a gadget that the average consumer in the United States uses for just over two years.
3
And sadly, the problems with smartphones do not end when a consumer is ready to repair or upgrade their phone. Major smartphone manufacturers are increasingly making product 
design decisions that take away an individual’s ability to 
replace the battery or add more memory. As a result, all the resources, energy, and human effort expended to make each phone are wasted, if the phone is damaged, needs 
a new battery, or the user outgrows the storage capacity. 
This greatly reduces the lifespan of the product and drives demand for new products and maximum profit.  
We are calling for a new business model, in which 
smartphone manufacturers take into account the impacts 
their popular devices are having on our planet, and the desire of consumers to slow down the rate of phones they go through in a decade. Manufacturers should measure their innovation not by fewer millimeters and more megapixels, 
but by designing  devices to last, by making them easily 
repairable and upgradeable, and using components and materials that can safely be reused again and again to make new phones. 
In 10 short years, smartphones have changed the world, and 
have fueled massive profits across the sector. But we cannot afford another 10 years of the same model. Now is the time 
to change the business model and get it right. Will the next 
decade be the one in which smartphone manufacturers take up this challenge, in which they are truly forward-thinking and set an example for all industries?
 IntroductionINTRODUCTION
Smartphones ha ve undeniably changed our lives and the world in 
a very short amount of time. Just 10 years ago, we took pictures with cameras, used maps to plan routes, and kept in touch with 
simple text messages.

2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 20132013 2014 2015 2016Starting with the release of Apple’s first iPhone, smartphone 
sales have soared, increasing year after year. In 2007, roughly 120 million smartphone units were sold worldwide. 
That number climbed to over 1.4 billion in 2016.
4 By 2020, 
smartphone subscriptions are expected to hit 6.1 billion, or 
roughly 70% of the global population.5 Among 18 to 35 year 
olds, smartphone ownership is already 62% globally, and in some countries, such as the United States, Germany, and 
South Korea, it tops 90%.
6
While part of the increasing rate of smartphone sales is 
caused by first-time buyers, 78% is estimated to be attributed to existing smartphone consumers replacing their phones.
8 
In the United States, the average replacement cycle was just over 2 years, at 26 months. Even though most smartphones still function for far longer than this, roughly two thirds of 
American consumers are lured in to prematurely upgrading 
for the latest features.
9 Some phones are even marketed 
as “free” with a new contract, which makes the effort and expense of repairing the current device seem like a greater 
obstacle.Indeed, the current business model for both manufacturers and service providers hinges on the frequent replacement of 
devices. This model does not take into account the long-term impacts of the production and disposal of all these devices—more than 7 billion since 2007.

 The supply chain for smartphones is long and complex. 
Generally speaking, phones are predominantly made up of a combination of metals including rare earth 
elements, glass, and plastic.  
Aluminum, cobalt, and gold are just a few of the more than 60 elements used to 
make advanced electronics such as smartphones, and they are obtained from mining operations around the world, or in some cases, from recycled materials. Plastic is derived 
from crude oil, and while some larger electronic devices contain some post-consumer 
recycled plastic, this is still an emerging practice in smartphones. Integrated circuits, such as memory chips, CPUs, and graphic chips are critical components of smartphones. These are made up of silicon wafers, the making of which requires a great deal of energy 
and water.

4  From Smart to Senseless: The Global Impact of 10 Years of SmartphonesSmartphone Materials Footprint Since 2007
 
While the amount of each element in a single device 
may seem small, and some inputs like copper are often 
secondary inputs, the combined impacts of mining and 
processing these precious materials for 7 billion devices, and counting, is significant. The search for ever increasing 
amounts of these virgin materials damages the earth and 
could potentially lead to the depletion of critical inputs, such as indium, which is estimated to have just 14 years 
of supply remaining based on current rates of extraction 
levels.
14
Despite these problems, the majority of the materials used to make smartphones are not recycled at the end of the 
product’s life. In 2014, less than 16% of global e-waste was 
estimated to be recycled in the formal sector—much of the rest likely went to landfill or incinerators, or was exported
15  
where dangerous informal disassembly operations threaten 
the health of local communities.16  
Even when e-waste is handled by a formal recycler the 
intricate design of smartphones presents a particular 
challenge for safe and efficient recycling. Disassembly is 
difficult by design, including the use of proprietary screws and glued in batteries; therefore, smartphones are often shredded and sent for smelting. Given the small amounts 
of a wide diversity of materials and substances in small 
devices, smelting is inefficient, or incapable, at recovering many of the materials, and plastics are consumed in the 
process.This table displays bill of material on an elementary level. As a consequence compounds such as PVC and flame retardants are not addressed. The 
materials listed are a selection of some of the most common materials used in smartphones. Calculations are based on the Oeko-Institut’s figures for a generic phone by mass.

Galaxy Note 7 – 4.3 million 
missed opportunities?
Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 recall should serve as a 
cautionary tale to all smartphone manufacturers–rushed design and production cycles can lead 
to dangerous and costly mistakes.  In response 
to over 90 reports of the Note 7 overheating or catching fire,
17 Samsung issued a global recall. 
After investigating, the company attributed the battery flaws, in part, to accelerated production 
efforts to outpace competitors.
18 Despite the 
$5.3 billion blunder, the company now has a 
unique opportunity to save its reputation and 
lessen its impact on the planet. After removing 
the faulty batteries, Samsung has 4.3 million opportunities to reuse its devices and support a circular production model. But as of February 
2017, the company has not been transparent 
about its plans to handle the recalled devices. 

From Smart to Senseless: The Global Impact of 10 Years of Smartphones  5  
 Electronics manufacturing is highly energy intensive and its 
energy footprint is growing significantly, as the volume and complexity of our electronics devices continues to expand. 
Various lifecycle analyses find the manufacturing of devices 
is by far the most carbon intensive phase of smartphones, accounting for nearly three quarters of total CO2 emissions.
20  
Since 2007, roughly 968 TWh has been used to manufacture smartphones. That is almost as much electricity for one 
year’s power for India, which used 973 TWh in 2014.
21 
Smartphones have become increasingly energy efficient over the years, which has helped to decrease greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions of the use phase significantly. Despite these improvements, the manufacturing phase remains incredibly reliant on fossil fuels.
The vast majority of smartphone production—both for 
component manufacturing and assembly—occurs in Asia. China alone accounts for 57% of global telephone exports.
22 
In China, the energy mix used to power manufacturing plants comes from an electricity grid dominated by coal, at 67%
23 
—a key factor driving the high carbon footprint of electronics devices, which in turn contributes to global warming.While a few smartphone companies have begun to report GHG emissions associated with the manufacturing of their products, including from their suppliers (see table on page 9), Apple is the only major smartphone manufacturer who has 
committed to extend its commitment to be 100% renewably 
powered
24 to its product supply chain.  Since making this 
commitment, Apple has signed two major contracts for renewable electricity in China, and two of its suppliers have 
also adopted their own commitment to become 100% 
renewably powered, and Foxconn has committed to deploy 400 MW of solar near its final assembly plant for Apple's iPhone production in Zhengzhou.

6  From Smart to Senseless: The Global Impact of 10 Years of SmartphonesThe Costs of a Broken Model
The current production and consumption model for most 
electronics remains inherently unsustainable, relying on 
ﬁnite materials, extracted and processed using chemically 
intensive processes and dirty energy to make short-lived 
products, designed for obsolescence. Economically 
speaking, it’s also not very smart.
Consumer mindsets are shifting. While smartphone sales 
continue to grow each year, existing smartphone users are 
increasingly less impressed with only incremental innovations 
from one model to the next. Most users are satisﬁed with a 
smartphone that is “good enough” to meet their needs to 
communicate and would prefer a device that lasts longer over 
having to replace their device every one to two years. Based 
on a 2016 survey by Greenpeace East Asia of consumer 
habits around the world, more than half felt smartphone 
manufacturers were releasing too many new models each 
year. Additionally, more than 80% of respondents felt it was 
important for new phones to be easily repaired and designed 
to last.26In 2014, United Nations University estimated that roughly 42 
million tons of e-waste was generated despite the materials 
therein being worth an estimated $52 billion USD. Three 
million tons were generated from small IT, like smartphones, 
alone. Globally, e-waste volumes are predicted to rise to 
50 million metric tons or more every year in 2017.27 This is 
roughly equivalent the weight of 25 million cars, using an 
average weight of 2 tons per car. This represents a massive 
waste of resources and a challenge of safe collection and 
handling. In Asia, e-waste volumes have been estimated to 
increase by 63% since 2012, greatly outpacing population 
growth and the region’s ability to handle this waste safely.28
Researchers at the University of British Columbia in Canada 
have found ways to recover copper and some rare earth 
elements from certain types of e-waste in a way that is cost 
comparable and equal in quality to mined minerals.29  This is 
just one of the thousands of projects around the world aimed 
at recovering valuable materials from electronics.30The Costs  of a Broken Mod el

Human Costs
In addition to the tremendous amounts of materials and 
energy that go into making smartphones, the current business model is driving significant human impacts in the 
supply chain. For example, it has been reported that in the 
Congo small-scale cobalt miners dig deep underground without maps or safety equipment and risk asphyxiation or being trapped.
31 In South Korea, more than 200 factory 
workers have made allegations that their life-threatening illnesses, including cancer, are a result of exposure to 
hazardous chemicals from working at semiconductor 
factories.
32 Proving occupational illness in even the most 
developed countries can be an onerous process. This, coupled with the fact that many miners lack access to 
basic health care services, and many factory workers 
may not notice signs of illness until they have moved on to another factory, makes it difficult to quantify the direct human cost of electronics manufacturing on workers. Additionally, manufacturing with dirty energy that contributes to climate change has impacts on human health and communities, beyond those people working along the electronics supply chain.

8  From Smart to Senseless: The Global Impact of 10 Years of SmartphonesA New ModeL - Circular Production
The obvious way to reduce the resource and energy 
impacts of raw materials extraction and manufacturing of smartphones is to use them as long as possible, to reuse 
components and parts, and then to reprocess the remaining 
materials for the manufacture of new products.
Many factors determine whether or not a gadget, and the 
materials it is comprised of, gets a longer life, but the most 
fundamental is the design of the product. Smartphones 
must be designed to be upgradeable—hardware must be upgradeable while software updates must lengthen, rather than shorten, a device’s life. Design choices to extend product life include 1) material selection, i.e. whether the plastic or metal is non-virgin and is suitable for clean recycling, 2) accessible components, so that devices can 
be easily repaired and later disassembled, 3) availability 
of software updates, repair manuals, and spare parts. Fairphone is one example that allows customers to replace and upgrade parts such as the screen or battery, without the 
need to replace the whole device.
33A New ModeL - Circular Production
The Need Action Steps
Reducing MaterialsCircular ProductionThe current linear production model requires massive amounts of 
virgin inputs, the sourcing of which damages the environment, depletes finite resources, and endangers workers and communities.Brands can reduce the need for virgin 
materials by using more recycled material 
inputs and reusing or refurbishing still-functional components.
Hazardous substances in devices perpetuate a toxic cycle, creating massive amounts of hazardous waste that endangers recyclers and 
makes a closed-loop production 
model very challenging.Brands need to phase out harmful substances in the design phase so that end-of-life handling can be safe and effective in closing the production loop 
cycles.
Extending 
Product LifeThe short life spans of smartphones exacerbate the toll these devices take 
on the planet’s finite resources. Brands need to design phones that are 
easy to repair and contain standard parts 
that can be replaced without the need 
to replace the whole device. Software updates should extend, or at minimum not end, older products’ lifespans
Reducing Dirty EnergyRenewable Energy ManufacturingSmartphone manufacturing is  energy-intensive and occurs in countries largely reliant on non-renewable energy like coal.Brands should require suppliers to report GHG emissions and set renewable energy and GHG reduction targets for its supply chain.

10  From Smart to Senseless: The Global Impact of 10 Years of SmartphonesWhat is meaningful Innov ation?
Consumers are increasingly concerned about the social 
and environmental impacts of products they buy. They want reliable, sustainably-made products that last. Ultimately, 
smartphone manufacturers need to embrace a slow, clean, 
closed-loop production model, powered by renewable energy.
CLOSED-LOOP: Recycled Materials
This approach allows device manufacturers to continue to serve new and existing customers, by ensuring ongoing access to a reliable source of secondary materials, such 
as precious metals and rare earth elements. The long-term 
ambition for closed-loop product cycles should be for companies to make products manufactured using recycled materials with zero use of finite virgin materials, in particular 
materials from mining. Device manufacturers should also 
look toward modularity—harvesting and reusing particularly energy-intensive components. 
SLOW REPLACEMENT: Repairable and Upgradeable 
Slowing the production cycle means making phones that last longer, which allows the resource and energy drain of each device to be spread over time. Extending lifespans is about 
designing more durable products, capable of being easily and 
inexpensively repaired or upgraded. It’s also about extending the lifespan of components, by harvesting parts from e-waste to reuse as spare parts or in new phones. 
CLEANING THE LOOP: Eliminate Hazardous 
Chemicals
Cleaning smartphone production means eliminating 
hazardous chemicals from the product itself and manufacturing process. This protects consumers, worker 
health and safety, and enables safer recycling without 
perpetuating the toxic cycle.
RENEWABLE: 100% Renewable Energy 
Manufacturing
Many IT companies are already leading the charge for 
renewable energy adoption by powering their data centers and offices with renewable energy. It’s time for brands to 
extend this commitment to the supply chain, ensuring their 
suppliers work to adopt renewable energy to power their operations.The smartphone is perhaps one of the best examples of human ingenuity of all time. However, the current production 
model is not one we would be proud to pass on to our 
grandchildren. With this report, we are challenging all electronics manufacturers to imagine a new way—a business model that in 10 years time will be unrecognizable compared 
to the current wasteful and harmful system. 
Imagine if technology was our strongest tool for creating a 
healthy, vibrant and thriving planet. Imagine if together we could harness technological innovation to help us overcome 
the Earth’s biggest challenges by sharing ideas and solutions 
across the world. 
As IT companies have shown again and again, technology 
and creativity can be used as powerful forces to disrupt 
outdated business models. Leading IT companies can 
become the greatest advocates for a closed-loop production model and a renewably powered future. The brightest designers can create toxic-free gadgets to last, be repaired, and ultimately transformed into something new. 
It’s time for the industry to adopt meaningful innovation—a 
slow, clean, closed-loop production model, powered by 
renewable energy. Who is going to be the first to take up the 
challenge?

Smartphone Manufactur er Progress Scoring  
This table includes only electronics manufacturers that sell 
branded smartphones, and evaluates their smartphone 
product line as well as company-level policies. This is NOT 
an exhaustive evaluation of each company’s sustainability 
performance, rather a look at emerging practices across the 
sector aimed at reducing material use and greenhouse gas 
emissions. Scoring is based on publicly available information.
Explanation of partial • scores: 
Chemical Elimination
• Acer: Some Acer phone models are free of PVC and 
BFRs, not accessories 
• Fairphone: Fairphone avoids PVC, BFRs, and phthalates; 
no information about beryllium or antimony and their 
compounds.
• Huawei: In 2016, Huawei announced plans to restrict 
these substances. So far only Mate S and Mate 8 phones 
are free of these substances.
• Lenovo: Elimination of PVC and BFRs is not complete; the 
other substance groups are ‘reportable’.
Recycled Materials
• Acer: Some Acer products contain PCR plastic ,  however, 
not reported as a % of total plastics used.
• Apple: Many Apple products contain PCR plastic; not 
reported as a % of total plastics used. Apple is prioritizing 
use of aluminium with high scrap content for some 
products.
• Lenovo: Lenovo reports overall use of PCR plastic by 
weight since 2005; not reported as a % of total plastics 
used.  Lenovo is closing the plastic loop by sourcing some 
PCR plastic from end-of-life IT equipment.
• LGE: LGE reports total use of PCR plastic by weight in 
2015; not reported as a % of total plastics used.
• Sony: Many Sony products contain some PCR plastic; not 
reported as a % of total plastics used. • Fairphone: The majority of Fairphone's casings are made 
from 50% PCR plastic; not reported as a % of total plastics used. Additionally, Fairphone reports that 50% of all tungsten 
comes from recycled sources. 
*An earlier version of this report evaluated Fairphone's use of recycled materials 
incorrectly. The company does use some recycled inputs.
