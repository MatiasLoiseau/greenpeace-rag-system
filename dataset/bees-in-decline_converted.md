executive summary

Executive Summary

Bees – including the managed honeybees, together
with many wild species – are the predominant and most
economically important group of pollinators in most
geographical regions. Managed honeybees, however, have
been suffering increasingly in recent years, even as the
world moves progressively towards growing more crops
that are dependent on bee pollination. Similarly, the role of
wild pollinators – bee species, as well as other insects – is
gaining relevance worldwide, and attracting increased
research attention. Moreover, wild bees are also threatened
by many environmental factors, including lack of natural
and semi-natural habitats, and increased exposure to
man-made chemicals.

Put in simple terms, bees and other pollinators – both
natural and managed – seem to be declining globally, but
particularly in North America and Europe. Lack of robust
regional or international programmes designed to monitor
the current status and trends of pollinators means there
is considerable uncertainty in the scale and extent of this
decline. Nonetheless, the known losses alone are striking.
In recent winters, honeybee colony mortality in Europe has
averaged around 20% (with a wide range of 1.8% to 53%
between countries).

The next time you see a bee buzzing
around, remember that much of the food
we eat depends significantly on natural insect-
mediated pollination – the key ecosystem
service that bees and other pollinators provide.

Without insect pollination, about one third of the crops
we eat would have to be pollinated by other means, or
they would produce significantly less food. Up to 75%
of our crops would suffer some decrease in productivity.
Undoubtedly, the most nutritious and interesting crops
in our diet (including many key fruits and vegetables),
together with some crops used as fodder in meat and
dairy production, would be badly affected by a decline in
insect pollinators; in particular, the production of apples,
strawberries, tomatoes, and almonds would suffer.

The most recent estimate of the global economic benefit
of pollination amounts to some €265bn, assessed as
the value of crops dependent on natural pollination. This
is not a “real” value, of course, as it hides the fact that,
should natural pollination be severely compromised or
end, it might prove impossible to replace – effectively
making its true value infinitely high.

And how much value can we place on the abundance of
colour that greets us on a bright spring day, for example?
Beside crop plants, most wild plants (around 90% of
them) need animal-mediated pollination to reproduce,
and thus other ecosystem services and the wild habitats
providing them also depend – directly or indirectly – on
insect pollinators.

executive summary

Three important concerns regarding the global
health of pollinators can be identified:

1

Currently, there are no
accurate data available
to reach firm conclusions
on the status of global
pollinators in terms of their
abundance and diversity.

2

As demand for pollinators –
both locally and regionally
– increases faster than the
supply, we could be facing
limitation of pollination,
currently and in the near
future. This is because the
growth in cultivation of high-
value, pollination-dependent
crops is outpacing growth in
the global stock of managed
honeybees, while wild
pollinator abundance and
diversity is also constrained.

3

Honeybee population
abundance is very uneven
among agricultural regions:
there is growth in some
honey-producing countries,
but decline elsewhere,
including regions with high
agricultural production
in the US, and in the UK
and many other western
European countries.

executive summary

In some specific regions of North America, East Asia and
Europe, the value of pollination can be as high as $1,500
US dollars per hectare; money that farmers – and society
at large – will be losing if pollinators were to decline in
those regions. Large parts of Italy and Greece have
exceptionally high values attached to pollination benefits,
together with extensive regions in Spain, France, the
UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria,
which also have high pollination value “hot spots”.

Recent “warning signals” of the tensions between
pollinator decline and crop yields may exist in the
observed increases in prices from 1993 to 2009 for some
pollination dependent crops. If we are to avoid additional
limits to food production and further deforestation to
increase the area of agriculture land, we must work
to address the underlying factors putting stress on
pollination services, focussing on the impacts on
honeybees and wild pollinators.

No single factor can be blamed for the overall global
decline in bee populations, or in their overall health.
This decline is undoubtedly the product of multiple
factors, both known and unknown, acting singly or in
combination.

Nonetheless, the most important factors affecting
pollinator health relate to diseases and parasites, and
to wider industrial agricultural practices that affect many
aspects of a bee’s life cycle. Underlying all the other
factors, climate change is also putting increased strains
on pollinator health. Some pesticides pose direct risk to
pollinators. The elimination of bee-harming chemicals
from agriculture is a crucial and most-effective first step to
protect the health of bee populations.

Diseases and parasites

Many beekeepers agree that the external invasive
parasitic mite, Varroa destructor, is a serious threat to
apiculture globally. Other parasites, such as Nosema
ceranae, have been found to be highly damaging to
honeybee colonies in some southern European countries.
Other new viruses and pathogens are likely to put further
pressure on bee colonies.

The ability of bees to resist diseases and parasites seems
to be influenced by a number of factors, particularly their
nutritional status and their exposure to toxic chemicals.
Some pesticides, for example, seem to weaken honeybees
that then become more susceptible to infection and
parasitic infestation.

Industrial agriculture

Pollinators, managed or wild, cannot escape the various
and massive impacts of industrial agriculture: they
suffer simultaneously from the destruction of natural
habitats caused by agriculture, and, because pollinators’
natural ranges inevitably overlap with industrial farming
landscapes, the harmful effects of intensive agricultural
practices.

Fragmentation of natural and semi-natural habitats,
expansion of monocultures and lack of diversity all play
a role. Destructive practices that limit bee-nesting ability,
and the spraying of herbicides and pesticides, make
industrial agriculture one of the major threats to pollinator
communities globally.

On the other hand, agriculture systems that work with
biodiversity and without chemicals, such as ecological
farming systems, can benefit pollinator communities, both
managed and wild. By increasing habitat heterogeneity
for bees, for example, ecological mixed-cropping systems
can provide additional flower resources for pollinators. This
emphasises the potential beneficial roles of ecological/
organic agriculture methods.

Climate change

Many of the predicted consequences of climate change,
such as increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall
patterns and more erratic or extreme weather events, will
have impacts on pollinator populations. Some of these
changes could affect pollinators individually and ultimately
their communities, becoming reflected in higher extinction
rates of pollinator species.

executive summary
executive summary

Insecticides

Insecticides in particular pose the most
direct risk to pollinators. As their name
indicates, these are chemicals designed
to kill insects, and they are widely applied
in the environment, mostly around
cropland areas. Although the relative role
of insecticides in the global decline of
pollinators remains poorly characterised, it
is becoming increasingly evident that some
insecticides, at concentrations applied
routinely in the current chemical-intensive
agriculture system, exert clear, negative
effects on the health of pollinators – both
individually and at the colony level.

The observed, sub-lethal, low-dose effects
of insecticides on bees are various and
diverse. These general effects can be
categorised as follows:

1) Physiological effects, which occur at
multiple levels, and have been measured
in terms of developmental rate (i.e. the
time required to reach adulthood), and
malformation rates (i.e. in the cells inside the
hive), for example.

2) Perturbation of the foraging pattern,
for example through apparent effects on
navigation and learning behaviour.

3) Interference with feeding behaviour,
through repellent, antifeedant, or reduced
olfactory capacity effects.

4)  Impacts of neurotoxic pesticides on
learning processes (i.e. flower and nest
recognition, spatial orientation), which are
very relevant and have been studied and
largely identified in bee species.

These negative effects serve as a warning about
unexpected impacts that bee-harming pesticides can
potentially have on other pollinators, and are a reminder
of the need to apply the precautionary principle to protect
pollinators as a whole, both managed and in the wild.
Restrictions applied only to crops attractive to honeybees
might still put other pollinators at risk from the impacts of
bee-harming pesticides.

executive summary

These seven chemicals are all widely used in Europe,
and at high concentrations have been shown to acutely
affect bees – mostly honeybees as the model target, but
also other pollinators. Further concerns arise from the
fact that impacts have also been identified as a result of
chronic exposure and at sub-lethal low doses. Observed
effects include impairment of foraging ability (bees getting
lost when coming back to the hive after foraging, and
an inability to navigate efficiently), impairment of learning
ability (olfactory – smelling- memory, essential in a
bee’s behaviour), increased mortality, and dysfunctional
development, including in larvae and queens (see Table 1
for a summary of the potential harms of the seven priority
chemicals).

The science is clear and strong: the potential harm of these
pesticides appears to far exceed any presumed benefits
of increased agricultural productivity from their role in pest
control. In fact, any perceived beneficial trade-offs are likely
to prove completely illusory. The risks of some of these
pesticides  – the three neonicotinoids in particular –  have
been confirmed by the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA), while it is very widely accepted that the economic
benefits of pollinators are, in parallel, very significant.

Some insecticides, illustrated by the group known as
neonicotinoids, are systemic, meaning that they do not
stay outside when applied to a plant, but enter the plant’s
vascular system and travel through it. Some neonicotinoid
insecticides are coated around seeds to protect them
when planted. When the coated seed starts to germinate
and grow, the neonicotinoid chemicals become
distributed throughout the plant stems and leaves, and
may eventually reach the guttation water (drops of water
produced by the seedling at the tip of the young leaves),
and later on the pollen and nectar. The increased use
of neonicotinoids means there is a greater potential for
pollinators to be exposed to these chemicals over longer
periods, as systemic insecticides can be found in various
places over the lifetime of a plant.

Bee-collected pollen can contain high levels of multiple
pesticide residues. Pollen is the main protein source for
honeybees, and it plays a crucial role in bee nutrition
and colony health. The potential for multiple pesticide
interactions affecting bee health seems likely, when so
many different residues are present in the environment
around bees. As one study has concluded: “Surviving on
pollen with an average of seven different pesticides seems
likely to have consequences.” (Mullin et al, 2010).

Bee-harming pesticides can be shortlisted in order to
focus action on the immediate potential risks to pollinator
health. Based on current scientific evidence, Greenpeace
has identified seven priority bee-harming insecticide
chemicals that should be restricted in use and eliminated
from the environment, in order to avoid exposure of
bees and other wild pollinators to them. This list includes
imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, fipronil,
chlorpyriphos, cypermethrin and deltamethrin.

executive summary

Ecological farming
Ecological or organic farming that maintains high
biodiversity without any application of chemical pesticides
or fertilisers has repeatedly been shown to benefit
pollinator abundance and richness. This in turn benefits
crop pollination, and hence potential yields. Organic or
ecological production methods bring out many other
benefits in addition to those related to pollinators. For
example, they can also enhance control of weeds,
diseases and insect pests, and inherently increase the
overall resilience of ecosystems.

However, these approaches have received significantly
less public funding for research targeted at developing
improved agricultural practices and management
compared to conventional chemical intensive techniques.
This lack of support is remarkable, given that ecological
and organic farming systems can produce more or less
the same amount of food – and profit – as conventional
farming, while generating far fewer environmental and
social harms. Accordingly, more public and private funding
is needed for research and development on improved
ecological farming practices. Ultimately such methods
represent the best options for maximising ecological
services, alongside food production and environmental
protection, while at the same time helping to promote
sustainable social and economic development.

What can we do?
Any progress in transforming the current destructive
chemical-intensive agricultural system into an ecological
farming system will have many associated benefits on
other dimensions of the environment and on human food
security, quite apart from clear benefits to global pollinator
health.

In the short to medium term, there are specific issues
that society can begin to address straight away, in
order to benefit global pollinator health. The benefits
could become evident almost immediately. Based
on analysis of the current science on global pollinator
health, Greenpeace believes that eliminating exposure to
pesticides with the potential to harm bees is a crucial step
in safeguarding not only managed and wild bees, but also
the high ecological and fiscal value of natural pollination.

Examples of scientifically based short to medium term
actions to help reverse the decline of global pollinators fall
into two basic groups:

1) avoid harm to pollinators (e.g. through eliminating
exposure to potentially harmful substances); and

2) promote pollinator health (e.g. through changing
other practices within existing agro-ecosystems).

Many practices that increase plant diversity, at different
scales, can improve the flower resources available to
pollinators, both in space and time.

The recent expansion of organic agriculture, together with
the growth of the application of techniques that reduce
and/or eliminate chemical pesticides (i.e. integrated
pest management), demonstrates that farming without
pesticides is entirely feasible, economically profitable and
environmentally safe.

European agriculture policies
European agricultural policies – first and foremost the
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – should incorporate
and act upon current scientific evidence about the
benefits of, and threats to, populations of both managed
honeybees and wild pollinators. Urgent action is required
to protect the essential ecosystem service of pollination.
The evidence outlined above of tools which already
exist to protect pollinators should be incorporated into
agricultural policies as a means of encouraging bee-
enhancing farming practices.

In addition, rigorous EU regulations on the use of
potentially bee-harming substances should be put
into place, following the precautionary principle by
incorporating current scientific evidence about harms
and vulnerability of honeybees. Precaution should also
extend to other wild pollinators, in view of their crucial role
in securing pollination services now and in an uncertain
future.

executive summary

Greenpeace demands
Honeybees and wild pollinators play a crucial role in
agriculture and food production. However, the current
chemical-intensive agriculture model is threatening both,
and is thereby putting European food supply at risk.

This report shows that there is strong scientific evidence
that clearly suggests that neonicotinoids and other
pesticides play an important role in the current bee decline.
Consequently, policy makers should:

1) Ban the use of bee-harming pesticides, starting with
the top-ranking most dangerous substances currently
authorised for use in the EU, i.e. the seven priority
chemicals imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin,
fipronil, chlorpyriphos, cypermethrin and deltamethrin (see
Table 1).

2) Through the adoption of pollinators’ national action
plans, support and promote agricultural practices that
benefit pollination services within agriculture systems,
such as crop rotation, ecological focus areas at farm level,
and organic farming methods.

3) Improve conservation of natural and semi-natural
habitats in and around agricultural landscapes, as well
as enhance biodiversity within agricultural fields.

4) Increase funding for research, development and
application of ecological farming practices that move
away from reliance on chemical pest control towards
the use of biodiversity-based tools to control pests and
enhance ecosystem health. EU policy makers should
direct more funding for ecological agriculture solutions
research under the auspices of the CAP (direct payments)
and Horizon 2020 (EU research framework).

Introduction: Importance of bees
and other pollinators for agriculture
and ecosystem conservation

“Bees are reaching their tipping point because they are expected to perform in an
increasingly inhospitable world.”

Human wellbeing is sustained and improved
by a number of ecosystem services (functions
provided by nature) that support our life on
Earth. These ecosystem services – such as
water purification, pest control, or pollination,
to name just a very few – are often taken for
granted as being there for our benefit, even
though they may not always be obvious as we
go on with our daily technologically-driven lives.
The next time you see a bee buzzing around, remember
that much of the food we eat depends significantly on
natural insect-mediated pollination – the key ecosystem
service that bees and other pollinators provide. Without
this essential function carried out by insects bringing
pollen effectively from one flower to another, about one
third of the crops we eat would have to be pollinated by
other means, or they would produce significantly less
food (Kremen et al, 2007). In addition, many wild plants
(estimated at between 60% and 90% of them) need
animal-mediated pollination to reproduce, and thus other
ecosystem services and the wild habitats providing them
also depend – directly or indirectly – on insect pollinators.

Grains like wheat, rice and corn, which make up a large
part of the global human diet, are mostly pollinated by
wind and are not so much affected by insect pollinators.
However, the most nutritious and interesting crops in our
diet such as fruit and vegetables, and some fodder crops
for meat and dairy production, would undoubtedly be
affected badly by a decline in insect pollinators (Spivak et
al, 2011).

– Spivak et al, 2010

Wild organisms involved in pollination include bees, many
butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, and wasps, together with
some birds and mammals. Commercially managed bee
species (primarily the honey bee, Apis mellifera) are also
significant pollinators. Indeed, bees are the predominant
and most economically important group of pollinators
in most geographical regions. In recent years, however,
managed honeybees have been increasingly suffering
from various diseases, pesticides and other environmental
stresses. Accordingly, the contributions of wild pollinators
to crop pollination (comprised of many other bee species
as well as other insects) appear to have been increasing in
relevance (Kremen and Miles 2012; Garibaldi et al, 2013).

In this report we focus mainly on bees. Most of the
scientific information on pollination relates to managed
honeybees, but also bumblebees to a lesser extent.
In referring often to bees as the iconic pollinators, we
nonetheless acknowledge the essential role played by
other insects and animals. In many cases, what affects
bee populations can also apply to other insect pollinators
(such as butterflies, flies, etc), although many specific and
complex factors make generalised assumptions very risky.
Much more scientific information is needed to fully assess
the status and health of insect pollinator communities.

The great majority of plants on Earth need animal
pollination to produce seeds and fruits; only a handful of
plant species do not need pollen  transfer from other plants
to reproduce and are not likely to be affected by changes
in the health of bee populations. Many of the plant species
that do require pollen transfer from neighbouring plants for
seed and fruit production could be dramatically impacted
as and when bee populations change; even where it is not
an essential requirement for reproduction, many tend to
produce more seeds and bigger fruits when bees transfer
pollen among them.

chapter one

In some European regions, viable populations of wild
honeybees do not exist, because they are not able to
survive the pressure from industrial agricultural practices
(monocultures, herbicides, pesticides), as well as the
pressure from a number of natural diseases and parasites,
without human management. In Spain, for example, only
domestic honeybees survive in highly-managed colonies
provided with external feeding and with drugs (Mariano
Higes, personal communication).

Humans have already occupied large areas of the
potentially cultivable land on Earth for agricultural
production, but in recent decades there appears to have
been a relative increase in the area dedicated to cultivation
of crops that depend on pollinators, both in developed
and developing countries. In developed countries there
has been a 16.7% increase in cropped land devoted to
pollinator dependent crops, while in developing countries
a 9.4% increase took place between 1961 to 2006) (Aizen
and Harder, 2009; Aizen et al, 2009). The abundance of
pollination services, however, has not kept pace with this
increase in crops that need pollination. This suggests there
might be undesired (and undesirable) consequences in the
form of declines in global agricultural production. In turn
this could further promote compensatory land conversion
to agriculture.

“Some commercial plants, such as almonds or
blueberries, do not produce any fruit without pollinators.
For many, a well-pollinated flower will contain more
seeds, with an enhanced capacity to germinate, leading
to bigger and better-shaped fruit. Improved pollination
can also reduce the time between flowering and fruit set,
reducing the risk of exposing fruit to pests, disease, bad
weather, agro-chemicals and saving on water.”

– UNEP, 2010

It has recently been estimated that 87.5% of flowering
plants are pollinated by animals (Ollerton et al, 2011).
This points to the crucial importance of bees – as one of
the chief global pollinators – to the maintenance of food
production and wild plant ecosystems. Animal pollination
results in increased fruit or seed in 75% of the world’s
leading food crops (Klein et al, 2007), and the most recent
estimate of the global economic benefit of pollination
amounts to a value of €265bn in productivity due to
pollination (Lautenbach et al, 2012). Of course, as with
any ecosystem service valuation, if any vital ecosystem
service is compromised, then its value tends towards
infinite if it cannot be replaced.

“The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United
Nations (FAO) estimates that out of some 100 crop
species which provide 90% of food worldwide, 71 of
these are bee-pollinated. In Europe alone, 84% of the 264
crop species are animal pollinated and 4 000 vegetable
varieties exist thanks to pollination by bees.”

– UNEP, 2010

“The production value of one tonne of pollinator-
dependent crop is approximately five times higher than
one of those crop categories that do not depend on
insects.”

– UNEP, 2010

The global and European
situation with bees and
other pollinators

“If wild pollinator declines continue, we run the risk of losing a substantial proportion
of the world’s flora.”

Bees and other pollinators, both natural
and managed, seem to be declining globally,
particularly in North America and Europe (Potts
et al, 2010). There is considerable debate
about this perceived decline, however, mostly
due to lack of robust regional or international
programmes designed to monitor the current
status and trends of pollinators (Lebuhn et al,
2013). Nonetheless, where they have been
documented, the scale and extent of the losses
are striking.

In the US the loss of 30-40% of commercial honeybee
colonies, which has occurred since 2006, was linked to
“colony collapse disorder”, a syndrome characterised by
disappearing worker bees (see references in Lebuhn et
al, 2013). Since 2004, losses of honeybee colonies have
left North America with fewer managed pollinators than at
any time in the last 50 years (UNEP, 2010).

China has 6 million bee colonies; about 200,000
beekeepers in this region raise western honeybees (Apis
mellifera) and eastern honeybees (Apis cerana). In recent
years, Chinese beekeepers have faced inexplicable colony
losses in both Apis species. These losses were largely
inexplicable and the associated symptoms highly complex.
Egyptian beekeepers based along the River Nile have also
reported symptoms of colony collapse disorder (UNEP,
2010).

In central Europe, estimated losses since 1985 point to a
25% loss of honeybee colonies, with a 54% loss in the UK
(Potts et al, 2010).

– Ollerton et al, 2011

“Since 1998, individual beekeepers in Europe have been
reporting unusual weakening and mortality in colonies,
particularly in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany,
the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain.
Mortality has been extremely high when activity is resumed
at the end of winter and beginning of spring.”

– UNEP, 2010

In recent winters, colony mortality in Europe has averaged
about 20% (with a wide range of 1.8% to 53% between
European countries)1. Over the 2008/09 winter, honeybee
losses in Europe ranged between 7% and 22%, and
over the 2009/10 winter between 7% and 30%. For
countries that participated in both years’ surveys, winter
losses appeared to significantly increase from 2008/09 to
2009/10.2

In addition to managed bee colonies, a decline in native
wild pollinators has also been widely reported in specific
locations across the globe (Cameron et al, 2011; Potts et
al, 2010). Well known examples include the UK and the
Netherlands (Biesmeijer et al, 2006).

Set against these observations is the fact that global honey
production appears to have been growing over the last
few decades. This has led to suggestions that honeybee
declines are very localised, mostly in North America and
Europe, and that these declines are compensated for
by increases in the major honey-producing countries
(China, Spain and Argentina) (Aizen and Harder 2009).

chapter two
chapter two

However, most scientists in the field agree that there are
three important concerns regarding the global health of
pollinators:

1) Currently, there are not accurate data available
to reach firm conclusions on the status of global
pollinators in terms of their abundance and
diversity (Lebuhn et al 2013; Aizen and Harder
2009). Indeed, potential variability in census
attempts for animal species is so high that
“populations may be reduced by almost 50%
before evidence for a decline could be detected”
(Lebuhn et al, 2013).

2) As the demand for pollinators – both locally and
regionally – increases faster than the supply, we
could face limitation of pollination, currently and
in the near future. This is because the growth in
cultivation of high-value, pollination-dependent
crops is outpacing growth in the global stock
of managed honeybees (Garibaldi et al, 2011;
Lautenbach et al, 2012). Wild bees are also
providing significant pollination services, especially
where there are limitations to pollination by
honeybees (as, for example, in the UK). However,
increasing agricultural intensification puts further
pressure on wild pollinators through habitat
destruction and reduced habitat diversity (Kremen
et al, 2007, Lautenbach et al, 2012). In addition, any
potential increase in managed honeybee hives is
unlikely to satisfy increased demand for agricultural
pollination or to mitigate any loss of native
pollinators (Aizen and Harder, 2009).

3) In spite of global increases, honeybee population
abundance is very uneven between agricultural
regions: there is growth in honey-producing
countries (Spain, China and Argentina) but decline
elsewhere, including regions with high agricultural
production in the US, and in the UK and many other
western European countries (Aizen and Harder
2009; Garibaldi et al, 2011; Lautenbach et al, 2012).

No regional, national or international monitoring
programmes exist, however, to document whether insect
pollinator decline is actually occurring. It is therefore
difficult to quantify the status of bee communities or
estimate the extent of any declines (Lebuhn et al, 2013).
Establishment of such programmes is urgently needed,
and would allow tracking of the global status and trends
of pollinator populations, as well as providing an early

warning system for pollinator decline. The cost of such a
system (estimated at $2m US dollars) represents a small
investment compared to the likely potential economic
cost of severe pollinator decline. Such programmes
would “allow for mitigation of pollinator losses and avoid
the financial and nutritional crisis that would result if
there were an unforeseen and rapid collapse of pollinator
communities.” (Lebuhn et al, 2013).

In conclusion, it seems clear that agriculture – and
therefore food production – is becoming more pollinator-
dependent over time. At the same time, there are
clear indications of some significant losses of wild and
domesticated pollinators. Recent “warning signals” of the
tensions between pollinator population decline and crop
yields may exist in the observed increases in producer
prices from 1993 to 2009 for pollination-dependent crops
(Lautenbach et al, 2012). If we are to avoid additional limits
to food production and further deforestation to increase
the area of agricultural land, we must work to address the
underlying factors putting stress on pollination services,
including impacts on honeybees and wild pollinators.

Moreover, demand for agriculture products, and the
corresponding need for pollination, obviously cannot grow
to the infinite. An equitable sustainable agriculture system
should put limits to its absolute production – and the
corresponding strain it puts on the planet – by supporting
global equitable diets with crops grown mostly for human
food, not animal feed, and with less animal protein
consumption. This will also allow for the preservation of
more natural and semi-natural areas and possibly release
some of the constraints on wild pollinators.

Economic value of pollination
The first global estimate carried out concluded that an
economic value of $117bn (€88bn) was associated with
pollination considered as a global ecosystem service
(Costanza et al, 1997). More recently, Gallai et al (2009)
revised this estimate, using an improved methodology,
to reach a value of $153bn (€115bn) (Gallai et al, 2009).
The most recent estimate, taking into account increases
in the relative importance of pollinator-dependent crops
in the global food supply, values pollination at €265bn
(Lautenbach et al, 2012). This rising trend highlights the
increase in our dependency upon pollinators in the global
food system, as well as the considerable uncertainties
associated with this kind of fiscal valuation of nature and
natural systems.

chapter two
chapter two

As with many contingent valuation exercises, the
economic value of pollination depends also on
perspective. For an individual farmer it might just be the
price that has to be paid to bring in managed bees to
the farm in the absence of other pollinators. In others,
it might be the value of foregone yields in farms lacking
natural pollination services. For example, in northern
Canada, canola in farms near uncultivated areas had
the advantage of more diverse and abundant wild
bees, and thus greater pollination and greater seed
yields (Morandin and Winston, 2006). The cost/benefit
analysis can become intricate. These authors suggest,
by extrapolation, that farmers could maximise profits
by not cultivating 30% of their farm area, so that they
receive higher yields on the remaining 70% and save
on cultivating costs in the fallow 30% (Morandin and
Winston, 2006).

Two examples of crop yield losses due to lack of
pollination, and associated institutional responses, are
summarised by Kremen et al 2007:

• “Following massive applications of the pesticide

fenitrothion (used for control of gypsy moth in nearby
forests) in Canada, both pollinator communities and
blueberry production declined (Kevan & Plowright
1989). Economic losses of blueberry growers
influenced government policy, causing a virtual ban on
the use of fenitrothion for gypsy moth control, and both
blueberry pollinators and crop production rebounded”
(Tang et al 2006).

• “Shortages of honey bee colonies in 2004 for almond
pollination prompted the United States Department of
Agriculture to alter honey bee importation policies to
allow shipments of honey bee colonies from Australia
into the USA.” (National Research Council of the
National Academies 2006).

The difficulty of arriving at an accurate valuation for
animal pollination arises from the fact that it contributes
much more than just simply the pollination of crops or
wild plants. By promoting fruit production in wild plants,
it also increases the food available for many insects,
birds, mammals, and fish, thereby directly contributing
to the maintenance of biodiversity. By also helping to
maintain plant productivity and vegetation cover, it also
contributes to many and various ecosystem services,
such as flood protection, prevention of erosion, control

of climate systems, water purification, nitrogen fixation,
and carbon sequestration (Kremen et al, 2007). Hence,
pollination is a key ecosystem service. By promoting plant
production generally, bees are also key to the many other
ecosystem services, in addition to food production alone,
that contribute to human wellbeing on the planet.

In a recent exhaustive study, Lautenbach et al (2012)
showed the distribution of pollination benefits and
vulnerabilities in a series of global maps. These were based
on the agricultural importance of pollination for different
regions. The analysis was based on estimates of the
monetary value of the part of agricultural production that
depends on pollination by animals, related, in turn, to the
crops grown in any given “cell” of a 5’ by 5’ (approximately
10km by 10km at the equator) latitude-longitude grid. These
global maps shed light on hot spots of pollination benefits,
as well as regions with high vulnerabilities, to any decline in
pollination ecosystem services (Lautenbach et al, 2012).

The global map of pollination services in Figure 1 highlights
in darker colours the regions where pollination services,
in units of US dollar per hectare, are highest: parts of
North America, East Asia and Europe all contain regions
where the value of pollination can be as high as $1,500
per hectare (Lautenbach et al 2012). That is money that
farmers – and society at large – will be losing if pollinators
were to decline in those regions.

Europe is very dense in terms of the amount of land
with high fiscal value attached to pollination benefits per
hectare (see Figure 1). Large parts of Italy and Greece
have exceptionally high values of pollination benefits,
together with extensive regions in Spain, France, the UK,
Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria, with
high pollination value “hot spots”. Poland, Hungary and
Romania also show regions where pollination values are
significant. Furthermore, Italy and Spain have relatively high
overall dependency of their agricultural systems on natural
pollination services (Lautenbach et al, 2012).

Globally, countries like Brazil, China, India, Japan and the
US also derive great economic benefits from pollination
services. In Africa, it is highest in Egypt, along the Nile. In
China, notional benefits from pollination increased by 350%
from 1993 to 2009, reflecting a push for fruit production to
meet demands from the growing urban middle class and for
export markets. China alone benefits by between 30% and
50% of the total global economic benefits that result from
pollination (Lautenbach et al, 2012).

Overall, the scientific research emphasises the urgent
need to protect our insects and the essential pollination
services they carry out: “Given the monetary value of
the pollination benefit, decision makers should be able
to compare costs and benefits for agricultural policies
aiming at structural diversity. Therefore, the information
provided in the map should be used when considering
modifications of agricultural policies such as the common
agricultural policy in the EU.” (Lautenbach et al, 2012).

“The benefit from pollination is high enough in a large part
of the world to seriously affect conservation strategies
and land-use decisions if these values were taken into
account.”

– Lautenbach et al, 2012

“Since 2001 the costs of production for pollination-
dependent crops have also risen significantly, indeed far
faster than the prices of non-pollination-dependent field
crops such as rice, grains or maize. For the researchers
this is an indication that the intensification of agriculture
is reflected in a global price increase for pollination-
dependent cultures. When fields are sprayed with more
pesticides, more fertilisers are applied and valuable
agricultural structural elements, such as hedges and
rows of trees, are transformed into fields, the insects
vanish.”

Research (UFZ), 20123.

The main factors affecting
bee populations’ health

There seems to be general agreement that
declines in bee populations and their overall
health (colony collapse disorder and other
phenomena) are the product of multiple factors,
both known and unknown, that can act singly
or in combination (Williams et al, 2010).

In general, bee declines can arise from three general
stressors:

Sick bees:
Bees suffer from their own diseases and parasites
that weaken and often kill them. Most of these diseases
and parasites are invasive species that cannot be
fought through the natural adaptation of native bees
or emergence of resistance. Sick bees, or bees with
parasites, can in turn be more vulnerable to other factors,
such as poor nutrition or exposure to toxic chemicals.

Hungry bees:
Bees feed on flowers, so they need a stable supply of
flowers both in space and time. Managed bees are given
supplementary feed by beekeepers to complete their feed,
but they still need flowers to collect pollen, their main food
and source of protein, from around hives. When there are
not enough blooming flowers during the bee season, as
for example in monocultures that produce only one kind
of flower during a peak time, bees are not able to feed
themselves and their progeny. Bees can go hungry as a
result of a diversity of factors, mostly related to industrial
agriculture practices: herbicides that reduce the diversity
of wild plants in and around farms; and the expansion of
agriculture that removes field margins, borders, hedges,
and so on, that hold a diversity of plants around farms. In
addition, climate change may modify flowering patterns,
displace plants that were major sources of food for bees in
a given area, or cause “season creep”, where flowering no
longer coincides with the emergence of bees in the spring.
(Kremen et al, 2007, Cameron et al, 2011).

Poisoned bees:
Many flowers, nest sites, and the general environment
around bees – including dust from farm operations – are
often contaminated with chemicals, mostly pesticides.
These insecticides, herbicides and fungicides are
applied to crops, but reach the bees through pollen,
nectar, and through the air, water or soil. These pesticides,
by themselves or in combination, can be toxic to bees
acutely in the short term or, in low-doses, with chronic
effects that weaken and can ultimately kill bees (see also
the following chapter).

 Bees in Decline Greenpeace Research Laboratories Technical Report (Review) 01/2013  23

chapter three

Different specific factors that have
been implicated in unhealthy bee
populations

Diseases and parasites: invasive species

Many beekeepers agree that the external parasitic mite,
Varroa destructor, is a serious threat to apiculture globally.
It seems to have originated in Asia, but has now spread
almost globally. Varroa is a small mite the size of a pinhead,
which feeds on the blood of the bee and spreads from hive
to hive. In addition to weakening the bees, Varroa can also
spread viral diseases and bacteria. Its effects are severe
and, if left uncontrolled, usually lead to the early death of
colonies within three years (UNEP, 2010).

Varroa and other pathogens have been linked to winter
loss of honeybee colonies, although in general there are
always multiple factors involved. For example, in Germany
it was found that high Varroa infestation, infection with
certain viruses, and additionally the queen’s age and the
weakness of the colony in autumn, were all related to
observed winter losses in honeybee colonies (Genersch et
al, 2010).

Another honeybee pathogen is the microsporidium
Nosema ceranae, which is found almost worldwide but is
more prevalent and damaging in Mediterranean countries
(for a current review see Higes et al, 2013). It has been
found to be highly damaging to honeybee colonies in
Spain and other southern European countries, but its
impacts seem less severe in northern European regions.
Nosema causes a high mortality rate in foragers, which in
turn affects colony development and may possibly end in
colony depopulation and collapse. In spite of the advances
in knowledge about Nosema in recent years, its role in
colony loss is still controversial, apparently due to its high
variance between different geographical regions (Higes et
al, 2013).

The ability of bees to resist diseases and parasites seems
to be influenced by a number of factors, particularly their
nutrition and their exposure to toxic chemicals.

For example, the combined exposure of honeybees to
the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid and the parasite
Nosema was found to significantly weaken honeybees
(Alaux et al, 2010). The combined effects of both agents
caused high individual mortality and stress, blocking the
ability of bees to sterilise the colony and their food, and
thus weakening the colony as a whole.

In another recent study, a higher proportion of bees reared
from brood comb with high levels of pesticide residues
were found to become infected with Nosema ceranae at
a younger age, compared to those reared in low-residue
brood combs (Wu et al, 2012).

“These data suggest that developmental exposure to
pesticides in brood comb increases the susceptibility of
bees to Nosema ceranae infection.”

– Wu et al, 2012

The authors concluded: “This study suggests there is
an increased susceptibility to N. ceranae infection in
treatment bees, which may be due to the added stress
of developing in pesticide-laden comb and the possible
utilisation of critical energetic resources and detoxifying
enzymes. Although the quantity and identification of the
mixed pesticide residues contained in comb Y and G are
known, we cannot definitively pinpoint causative active
ingredients. Nonetheless, interactive effects between
pesticide exposure and N. ceranae infection need further
investigation, especially considering the levels of pesticide
residues found in brood comb.”

Another recent study showed that exposure to sub-lethal
doses of the pesticides fipronil and thiacloprid caused much
higher mortality to honeybees previously infected by
N. ceranae than in uninfected ones (Vidau et al, 2011).

In light of these and other interactions, there is a clear
need for more studies to tease apart the multiple factors
that place stresses on pollinator health. In addition, these
studies focused solely on honeybees. Other pollinators like
bumblebees share similar sensitivities to pesticides, similar
parasites like Nosema, and their populations are also
declining (Williams and Osborne, 2009; Alaux et al, 2010;
Winfree et al, 2009; Cameron et al, 2011). More studies,
together with stronger actions based on the precautionary
principle, are needed to limit potentially interactive factors
such as the possibility of an increased susceptibility to
diseases with exposure to pesticides, and thereby protect
the overall health of pollinators on a global basis.

Industrial agriculture

Agriculture, in both croplands and pastures, occupies
about 35% of the ice-free land surface on Earth, and
is one of the largest ecosystems on the planet, rivalling
forests in extent (Foley et al, 2007). In addition, agriculture
has been quickly becoming increasingly industrialised
over the past century or so. This has taken the form of
greater use of fertilisers, more toxic chemicals, more
monoculture crops, and the increased expansion of
agriculture into other land. All make the impact of current
agriculture on the environment a tremendously damaging
one (Tilman et al, 2001; Foley et al, 2011; Rockstrom et
al, 2009).

Pollinators, managed or wild, cannot escape the
various and massive impacts of industrial agriculture.
They suffer simultaneously from the destruction of their
natural habitats by agriculture, and also from the harmful
effects of intensive agricultural practices when their
natural ranges overlap (inevitably), with industrial farming
landscapes.

Industrial agriculture affects bees and other pollinators in
a variety of ways, but in particular:

Intensification of agriculture prompts the loss and
fragmentation of valuable natural to semi-natural
perennial habitats for pollinators, such as agroforestry
systems, grasslands, old fields, shrublands, forests, and
hedgerows. This is thought to be the major cause of
wild pollinator declines, although with smaller effects on
managed honeybees (Brown and Paxton, 2009; Winfree
et al, 2009).

Industrial monocultures and, in general, the lack of plant
biodiversity within and around croplands, limit the amount
of food that pollinators have access to, both in space and
time. A parallel decline in plant diversity at the local scale
with the decline in bees and other pollinators has been
shown both in the UK and the Netherlands (Biesmeijer
et al, 2006), and it is possibly a much more widespread
phenomenon.

Practices such as tillage, irrigation, and the removal of
woody vegetation, destroy nesting sites of pollinators
(Kremen et al, 2007).

Large-scale herbicide application drastically reduces non-
crop plant diversity and abundance, and thus limits food
availability for bees at any given moment. The chemical
destruction of habitats through the massive application of
herbicides can have long term consequences, particularly
on the distribution of pollinators in agro-environments
(UNEP, 2010).

Finally, widespread and ubiquitous use of pesticides,
common practice in the current chemical intensive
agriculture systems, can lead to mortality and/or altered
foraging abilities for both wild and managed bees (this
element is addressed in detail in the following chapter).
Determining the specific role of pesticides in pollinator
health is further complicated because sites where pesticide
use is intense often also correspond with places with
low availability of both flower resources and nesting sites
(important for many wild pollinators) (Kremen et al, 2007).
Differentiating among the relative weight of the different
impacts remains an important challenge.

Agricultural intensification from local to landscape-scale is
generally correlated with a decline in the abundance and
richness of wild pollinators, and hence in the ecosystem
services they provide to crops (Kremen et al, 2007).
Intensification is also likely to impact negatively on the
health and stability of honeybee populations.

chapter three
chapter three

In addition to species level effects, climate change will very
likely affect the interaction between pollinators and their
sources of food, i.e. flowering plants, by inter alia changing
the dates and patterns of flowering. Recent analysis
has suggested that between 17% and 50% of pollinator
species will suffer from food shortages under realistic
scenarios of projected climate change that cause modified
plant flowering pattern plants (Memmott et al, 2007). The
authors concluded that the anticipated result of these
effects is the potential extinction both of some pollinators
and some plants and hence the disruption of their crucial
interactions (Memmott et al, 2007).

In conclusion, climate change – in addition to its predicted
impacts in the form of species extinctions – may also
lead to “the large-scale extinction of interactions which
are responsible for a key ecosystem service, that of the
pollination of plants.” (Memmott et al, 2007).

In contrast to these general negative impacts, some
studies show certain positive effects of agriculture on
pollinator communities, for example by increasing floral
resources in fragments of natural habitats (Winfree et
al, 2006, in Kremen et al, 2007). Significantly, however,
these positive effects seem to occur in regions where
the type of agriculture increases, rather than decreases,
habitat heterogeneity for bees (such as small farms, mixed
cropping, hedgerows, etc.) (Tscharntke et al, 2005, in
Kremen et al, 2007), emphasising the potential beneficial
roles of ecological/organic agriculture methods.

In addition, farming itself can suffer from pollination
limitation, reflecting the often-difficult co-existence of
industrial agriculture with the pollinators on which it, in
part, depends.

Climate change

Many of the predicted consequences of climate change,
such as increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall
patterns, and more erratic or extreme weather events, will
have impacts on pollinator populations. Such changes
might affect pollinators individually and ultimately their
communities, reflected in higher extinction rates of
pollinator species (UNEP, 2010).

For example, it has been documented how honeybees in
Poland are responding to changes in climate by advancing
the date of their first winter flight (the wakening moment
after winter), part of a phenomenon often known generally
as “season creep”. The first winter flight date has advanced
by over one moth during 25 years of observations, and
this is attributed to increasing temperatures (Sparks et al,
2010).

 Insecticides

chapter four

4

Insecticides are a particular class of pesticide
specifically designed to kill insect pests of crops
and livestock, or in domestic environments.
They kill or repel insect pests at high enough
doses (lethal), but they also may have
unintended (sub-lethal) effects at low doses
on non-target insects, including upon the
natural enemies of pests and upon pollinators
(Desneux et al, 2007). Because of their intrinsic
nature and function, insecticides are the group
of pesticides that pose the most direct risk to
pollinators.

Although the relative role of insecticides in the global
decline of pollinators remains poorly characterised, it is
now more evident than ever that some insecticides show
clear negative effects on the health of pollinators, both
individually and at the colony level (Henry et al, 2012;
Whitehorn et al, 2012; Easton and Goulson, 2013; Mullin
et al, 2010). This is clear even when most studies of the
effects of insecticides are focussed primarily upon acute
effects taking place at relatively high levels of exposure.
More subtle, long-term effects of exposure to low doses
have not been consistently analysed or targeted in toxicity
studies. In addition, most studies have focused on the
honeybee (and to a lesser extent upon the bumblebee),
neglecting the potential impacts upon other of the many
species of wild pollinators that are clearly important for
crop pollination and biodiversity maintenance (Potts et al,
2010; Brittain et al, 2013a; Easton and Goulson, 2013).

Insecticides, both at high and low doses, can potentially
impact pollinators even though they have not been
deliberately targeted. Such chemical exposure, however,
tends to be fairly ubiquitous for a number of reasons:

1. Agriculture, globally, now uses the highest volume
of pesticides than at any other point in history (Tilman
et al, 2001).

2. Residues of insecticides can reach, and potentially
persist, in many places around treated crops that also
provide habitat for many pollinator species. Residues
of insecticides can, for example, persist in farm
soils, be mobilised in dust and air following seeding
operations or spraying, reach watercourses around
farms, or be present in pollen and nectar of crop plants
and neighbouring weeds. They may ultimately be
found in the wax of hives (Mullin et al, 2010).

3. Some insecticides are systemic, meaning that they do
not stay outside when applied to a plant, but enter the
plant system and travel through it. For example, some
neonicotinoid insecticides, which are systemic in mode
of action, are coated around a seed to protect it when
planted. When the coated seed starts to germinate and
grow, the neonicotinoid chemicals become distributed
through the plant stems and leaves, and may eventually
reach the guttation water (drops of water produced by
the seedling at the tip of the young leaves). Bees often
drink from these guttation drops in fields of coated-
seeds crops, and thus will be exposed to this chemical
(Girolami et al, 2009). Further, when a plant grown
from a neonicotinoid coated-seed produces flowers,
residues of the chemical can also be found in pollen and
nectar. Consequently, bees feeding on these flowers
will potentially be exposed to the chemicals in this way
as well. The increased use of neonicotinoids means
there is a greater potential for pollinators to be exposed
to these chemicals over longer periods, as systemic
insecticides can be found in various places throughout
the life cycle of a plant, growing from coated seed, to
guttation water, and to the pollen and nectar of plants
throughout their blooming period (Ellis, 2010).

chapter four

Effects of insecticides on pollinators can be described as
acute or lethal, when the effects are quick and severe and
cause rapid mortality, and sub-acute or sub-lethal, when
the effects do not induce mortality in the experimental
population, but may provoke more subtle physiological
or behavioural effects in the longer term, for example
by impacting learning performance, behaviour or other
aspects of neurophysiological performance (Desneux et
al., 2007).

Historically, most attention has been given to the acute
impacts of chemicals on honeybees, while the problems
of sub-lethal effects, that might nevertheless impact
pollinator health and reduce agricultural production, were
less well understood and much more poorly documented.
Even so, there are abundant examples of documented
sub-lethal effects (Desneux et al, 2007), and these can be
classified in four loose groups based on the nature of the
observed effects:

1) Physiological effects, which occur at multiple levels,
and have been measured as developmental rate (i.e. time
required to reach adulthood) or malformation rates (i.e. in
the cells inside the hive), for example.

2) Perturbations of the foraging pattern of honeybees,
for example through effects on navigation and behaviour.

3) Interference with feeding behaviour by repellent,
antifeedant, or reduced olfactory capacity effects.

4) Impacts of neurotoxic pesticides on the learning
processes (i.e. flower and nest recognition, spatial
orientation) of insects, which are very relevant and have
been largely identified and studied in the honeybee.

Examples of
sub-lethal effects

Physiological and developmental effects

The pyrethroid deltamethrin has been shown in laboratory
analysis to affect a wide range of cellular functions in
honeybees, for example by causing marked dysfunctions
in the heart cells, with changes in the frequency and force
of cardiac contractions. In addition, when associated
with the chemical prochloraz, it has been shown to affect
thermoregulation and cause hypothermia in honeybees,
although this effect is not observed when deltamethrin is
used alone (Desneux et al, 2007).

Exposure to low sub-lethal concentrations of the
neonicotinoid thiamethoxam in the Africanised honeybee
can cause impairment in the function of the brain and
mid-gut, and contribute to lifespan reduction (Oliveira et al,
2013).

The neonicotinoid imidacloprid has shown damaging
effects even at very low doses on bumblebee colony
development, and especially on queen bees (Whitehorn
et al, 2012). Bumblebees eating food contaminated with
tiny amounts of imidacloprid do not grow so well, and as
a result their colonies are smaller (8-12% smaller). More
importantly, this translates into a disproportionately large
decline in the number of queens: one or two queens as
compared to the 14 found in pesticide-free colonies.
Queens are fundamental to colony survival, as they are the
only individuals that survive the winter and go on to found
colonies the following spring (Whitehorn et al, 2012).

A recently published laboratory study (Hatjina et al,
2013) has shown that exposure to sub-lethal doses
of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid resulted in marked
changes in the  respiratory pattern of bees, and also
in hypopharyngeal glands growing to a smaller size as
compared to untreated bees. The researchers concluded
that physiological impacts caused by exposure to
imidacloprid needed to be considered in addition to other
measures of impact because they too have implications
at both the individual level and at the level of the whole
colony.

Mobility

Feeding behaviour

“In the case of honey bees, impaired feeding behaviour
can induce a drastic decline in hive population. Most
of the large-scale farming areas, when food resources
are reduced to cultivated plants, the repellent effect
of pesticides may reduce pollen and nectar uptake,
potentially leading to a demographic decrease of the
colony.”

– Desneux et al, 2007

Pyrethroids are probably the best-known case of
pollinator-repellent insecticides, and this avoidance
behaviour was assumed in many cases to be an
adaptation for reducing the risk of exposure (Desneux
et al, 2007). However, it was subsequently shown that
pyrethroid applications during peak foraging activity
(in broad daylight) result in high exposure levels (see
discussion in Desneux et al, 2007).

 “Therefore, a repellent effect must not be misconstrued as
providing any protection against exposure to pesticides.”

– Desneux et al, 2007

Pesticide exposure can also reduce the capacity of bees to
detect food sources. For example, fipronil applied topically
at low concentrations to honeybees decreased their
capacity to sense low-sucrose concentrations by about
40% relative to the capacity of untreated bees (El Hassani
et al, 2005).

Imidacloprid repels some pollinators (pollinating flies and
beetles), so their exposure might be reduced, but as a
result pollinators could starve if the only feed available is
from imidacloprid-treated crops in agricultural regions.
In addition, if insects do avoid visiting the flowers of
treated crops, this could impact adversely on crop yields,
depending upon the strength of the response and how
abundant the pollinators are (Easton and Goulson, 2013).

Under laboratory observation, the neonicotinoid
imidacloprid was found to affect the mobility of honeybees
at low doses. This effect was dose-dependent and
changed with time (Suchail et al, 2001; Lambin et al,
2001), revealing that the time of observation could be
crucial in detecting some of the more subtle effects of
insecticides.

In another laboratory experiment, sub-lethal doses of
imidacloprid caused significant reductions in mobility.
Bees were less active than untreated bees, although this
effect was transitory. Bees also showed a loss of ability to
communicate, and this could have profound effects upon
social behaviour (Medrzycki et al, 2003).

Navigation and orientation

For some pollinators, visual learning of landmarks is
important for spatial orientation. For example, honeybees
use visual landmarks to navigate to a food source, as well
as to communicate accurately to the rest of the colony
about distance and direction to it. Pesticides might affect
both the learning of visual patterns during foraging trips
and the communication of this information back in the
hive.

The pyrethroid deltamethrin has been shown to alter the
homing trips of foragers treated topically with sub-lethal
doses, decreasing the number of flights back to the hive in
treated foragers (Vandame et al, 1995).

A recent highly sophisticated study performed under
semi-natural conditions with honeybees showed that
bees eating pollen or nectar contaminated with the
neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, even at very low doses,
can get lost on their way back home. As a result, they
are twice as likely to die within a day, making the colony
weaker and putting it at greater risk of collapse (Henry et
al, 2012).

The neonicotinoid imidacloprid has also been shown
to impact honeybee foraging trips at low concentrations,
causing delays in feeding trips and increased losses
when bees are fed sub-lethal doses of the pesticide (Yang
et al, 2008).

Foraging trips of honeybees were reduced by between
20% and 60% when exposed to either the neonicotinoid
imidacloprid or the pyrethroid deltamethrin. Deltamethrin
also induced changes in learning capabilities (Ramirez-
Romero et al, 2005).

chapter four
chapter four

Honeybees have often been used as a model organism
to study sub-lethal effects of pesticides on pollinator
communities, but they are considered to poorly represent
effects on other pollinators, including other bees. Indeed,
bees are a very diverse group, with major differences in
their vulnerability to pesticide exposure.

“In honey bees, pesticides may affect social organisation
(reduction of food uptake or reduction of worker/brood
population), but these effects may be compensated for
because the queen does not take part in foraging and
is probably less likely to be exposed than workers. In
contrast, in other social pollinators such as bumblebees,
the queen must find food during spring in order to found
the colony. In this case, the potential negative effects of
pesticides may substantially affect colony establishment.
In summary, social pollinators having no perennial colony
and no social pollinators are more likely to suffer from
insecticide exposure.”

– Desneux et al, 2007

In addition, pollinators with certain traits may be more
vulnerable to insecticides. For example, aphidophagous
hoverflies lay their eggs within crop fields, potentially
exposing their offspring to insecticides (Brittain and Potts,
2011). Differential risks related to specific pollinator traits or
life habits could result in disturbance by insecticides. This
exposure could alter the pollinator community composition
and therefore possibly alter the floral community in turn,
in a non-random way (Brittain and Potts, 2011). Such
potential effects serve as a warning about unexpected
impacts of bee-harming pesticides on other pollinators,
and as a reminder of the need to apply the precautionary
principle to protect pollinators as a whole, both managed
and wild. Other pollinators might still be at risk from the
impacts if proposed restrictions on bee-harming pesticides
are only applied to those crops attractive to honeybees.

Learning performance

Effects of pesticides on learning processes have been
the target of several studies in honeybees, because of
the importance of learning to their foraging efficiency, and
because they offer a reasonably well understood system
(Desneux et al, 2007). Olfactory learning and memory in
honeybees play a crucial role in their feeding strategy and
the efficiency of foraging trips, both at the individual and
at the colony level. Thus, negative effects of long-term
exposure to low concentrations of pesticides could play a
critical role in honeybee colony health.

In laboratory conditions, the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam
and fipronil at sub-lethal doses decreased the olfactory
memory of bees. Honeybees were unable to discriminate
between a known and an unknown odorant. Fipronil-
treated bees also spent more time immobile (Aliouane et
al, 2009).

In bioassay experiments with different pesticides,
honeybees surviving oral exposure to imidacloprid,
fipronil, deltamethrin and endosulfan showed reduced
learning performance in the longer term (Decourtye et
al, 2004; Decourtye et al, 2003; Decourtye et al, 2005).
Low-dose exposure of honeybees to imidacloprid seems
to impair their medium-term olfactory memory (Decourtye
et al, 2004). The consequences of these chronic effects
on foraging behaviour are still uncertain (Desneux et al,
2007).

The impacts of sub-lethal effects
of pesticides on other pollinator
communities

Sub-lethal effects of pesticides seem to affect multiple
functions involved in the health of honeybee and
bumblebee communities (i.e. foraging, fecundity,
mobility). It is possible that they impact on other pollinator
communities as well. The analysis of sub-lethal effects
on the community ecology of many pollinators remains
very poorly understood (Desneux et al, 2007). In addition,
most examples of how insecticides affect pollinators are
at the species level, and there is little information on the
impacts on wild pollinators at the community level.

chapter four
chapter four

Exposure to multiple pesticide residues and
synergic effects

In industrial agricultural areas there is high potential for
exposure of pollinators to a mixture of agrochemicals,
including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and others.

Herbicides may affect bees by limiting the food resources
available to them and to other pollinators, especially if
the large-scale crop monocultures typical of industrial
agriculture are also present (Brittain and Potts, 2011).
The body size of the pollinator might determine the overall
impact, with smaller species being more impacted. Larger
bees might be able to fly further foraging for food, but
smaller ones might starve (Brittain and Potts, 2011).

“Herbicides have also been found to increase the toxicity
of a number of insecticides in flies and mice, but this has
not been documented for bees. A sub-lethal impact of
an insecticide that reduces bees’ foraging efficiency may
have more damaging consequences for its health if the
bees are exposed at a time when its food resources have
been reduced by the application of herbicides.”

– Brittain and Potts 2011

Farmers routinely apply fungicides to many bee-pollinated
crops during the blooming period when bees are foraging,
as they are classified as less toxic to bees, and currently
there are few restrictions to this practice. However, some
fungicides have exhibited direct toxicity to honey or
solitary bees at field use rate (Mullin et al, 2010). Equally as
worrying, some fungicides have been found to increase
the toxicity to honeybees of pyrethroid insecticides
(Brittain and Potts, 2011).

Several studies indicate the possibility of synergistic
interactions of pesticides with fungicides. Ergosterol-
biosynthesis-inhibitors (EBI) interacts synergistically with
pyrethroids (Nørgaard and Cedergreen, 2010). Exposure
to deltamethrin in combination with the fungicides
prochloraz or difenoconazole induced hypothermia in
honeybees at doses that did not induce a significant effect
on thermoregulation when used alone (Vandame et al,
1998). Another study found that a common neonicotinoid,
thiacloprid, becomes some two orders of magnitude
times more toxic to honeybees when combined with
the fungicide propiconazole, and some three orders
of magnitude times more toxic when combined with
triflumizole (Iwasa et al, 2004).

EFSA in a late 2012 report stated: “Significant synergy
has been reported between EBI fungicides and both
neonicotinoids and pyrethroid insecticides but in some
cases where high levels of synergy are reported the doses
of fungicides have been well in excess of those identified
in the exposure section of this report. … Greater synergy
is observed in the laboratory between EBI fungicides at
field rates application rates [sic] and pyrethroids used
as varroacides (flumethrin and fluvalinate) and between
coumaphos and fluvalinate varroacides.” (Thompson,
2012).

However, the implications of these results and of the
potential interactions of fungicides with other insecticides
remains very poorly characterised, despite the potential
importance of such findings (Mullin et al, 2010).

In addition to interactions between different pesticides,
insecticides have also been shown to interact with other
stress-causing factors, such as parasite infestations
(Alaux et al, 2010, Wu et al, 2012). For example, “the
mortality of honeybees from the insecticide imidacloprid
(neonicotinoid) was found to be greater in bees infected
with the parasite Nosema and a synergistic interaction
between the two factors was found to reduce enzyme
activity related to colony-food sterilisation” (Alaux et al,
2010; Brittain and Potts, 2011).

“Pollinators are being increasingly exposed to a cocktail
of pesticides, for instance up to 17 different pesticides
detected in just one sample of pollen from a honeybee
colony (Frazier et al, 2008); and this has unknown
consequences for bee health and pollination services.
Given the prediction of increasing global pesticide
production (Tilman et al, 2001) and cultivation of pollinator
dependant crops (Aizen et al, 2008), this issue is likely to
increase in importance in the future. There are difficulties
in disentangling the impacts of insecticides from other
aspects of agricultural intensification, and the cumulative
and synergistic effect of multiple insecticide applications
further complicates the issue.”

– Brittain and Potts 2011

Residues of pesticides in honeybee hives

The largest sampling exercise carried out to date – of
pesticide residues in honeybee hives, which targeted
pollen, wax and the bees themselves – was recently
performed in North America. This showed that honeybees
are routinely exposed to multiple pesticides (Mullin et
al, 2010). The authors found  “unprecedented levels of
miticides and agricultural pesticides in honeybee colonies
from across the US and one Canadian province”.

This study clearly showed that bee-collected pollen
might contain high levels of multiple pesticide residues,
including significant amounts of the insecticides aldicarb,
carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, the fungicides
boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and the herbicide
pendimethalin. They also found high levels of fluvalinate
and coumaphos. These latter two are miticides that are
often applied by beekeepers within their hives to control
Varroa infestations.

Pollen is the main protein source for honeybees, and it
plays a crucial role in bee nutrition and colony health.
Interactions between multiple pesticides seem entirely
possible when so many different residues are present
in the environment around bees. Ten pesticides were
found in pollen at greater than one tenth the bee LD50
level, indicating that sub-lethal effects of these toxicants
alone are possible (Mullin et al, 2010). Overall, “surviving
on pollen with an average of seven different pesticides
seems likely to have consequences”.

In addition to insecticides, fungicides were the most
significant pesticide residues found in pollen. The authors
noted a correlation between some fungicides and poor
health in the hives (Mullin et al, 2010). As explained above,
fungicides might exacerbate the damaging effects of
some insecticides on honeybees.

Highly toxic pyrethroids, including deltamethrin and
bifenthrin, were the most frequent and dominant class
of insecticide found in the North American survey, at
levels that could prove lethal to honeybees under some
conditions. In addition, pyrethroids are often applied by
farmers together with certain fungicides, some of which,
again, have been shown to increase the toxicity of some
pyrethroids to bees

“Potential for interactions among multiple pyrethroids and
fungicides seems highly likely to impact bee health in ways
yet to be determined.”

– Mullin et al, 2010

Neonicotinoid residues were often found on pollen and in
wax, generally at lower levels than pyrethroids. However,
one pollen sample contained an exceptionally high level of
imidacloprid. The potential for neonicotinoids to interact
with other pesticides remains poorly understood (Mullin et
al, 2010).

The authors conclude: “The widespread occurrence
of multiple residues, some at toxic levels for single
compounds, and the lack of any scientific literature on the
biological consequences of combinations of pesticides,
argues strongly for urgent changes in regulatory
policies regarding pesticide registration and monitoring
procedures as they relate to pollinator safety. This further
calls for emergency funding to address the myriad holes
in our scientific understanding of pesticide consequences
for pollinators. The relegation of bee toxicity for registered
compounds to impact only label warnings, and the
underestimation of systemic pesticide hazards to bees
in the registration process may well have contributed to
widespread pesticide contamination of pollen, the primary
food source of our major pollinator. Is risking the $14 billion
contribution of pollinators to our food system really worth
lack of action?” (Mullin et al, 2010).

Sampling in Europe of honeybee hive material has also
shown residues of pesticides. For example, in apiaries
across Spain, both acaricides (to fight mites) and
agriculture pesticides were found in beebread, including
some insecticides with high sub-lethal bee-toxicity, namely
cypermethrin, deltamethrin and chlorpyrifos. Acaricides
were found in much higher amounts than agricultural
pesticides (Orantes-Bermejo et al, 2010). In Slovenia,
honeybee colonies based in apple orchards treated with
insecticides showed residues in beebread up to 16 days
after treatment for diazon, and in pollen loads up to 6 days
after application of thiacloprid and up to 10 days after
application for diazinon (Škerl et al, 2009).

Shortlist of bee-harming
pesticides: the seven priority
bee-harming chemicals

Based on available evidence on pesticide usage in
Europe, and impacts on bees and other pollinators,
we have drawn up a list of bee-harming pesticides
that should be eliminated from the environment
in order to avoid any acute poisoning with lethal
effect, and potential sub-lethal harm, to pollinators.
Based on current scientific evidence, Greenpeace
has identified seven priority insecticide chemicals
that should be restricted in use, and eliminated from
the environment in order to avoid exposure of bees
and other wild pollinators to them. These seven
priority chemicals are imidacloprid, thiamethoxam,
clothianidin, fipronil, chlorpyriphos, cypermethrin
and deltamethrin. See Table 1 for a brief summary
on the characteristics of each pesticide, and some
references that evidence potential harms and the
need to apply the precautionary principle to exclude
their presence in the environment.

Neonicotinoid pesticides

 Neonicotinoids have become one of the most commonly
used insecticides over the past few decades. There
are two neonicotinoid subclasses: nitroguanidines
and cyanoamidines. Nitroguanidines, which include
imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam and dinotefuran,
are acutely toxic to honeybees, and their oral toxicity is
extremely high at 4-5 ng/ individual bee. According to
the manufacturers of these insecticides, neonicotinoids
have been “the fastest growing class of insecticides with
widespread use against a broad spectrum of sucking and
certain chewing pests.” (Jeschke et al, 2010). Parallel to
this growth in use has been increasing concern about their
potential effects on pollinators, especially on honeybees
and bumblebees (many research papers have been
produced together with reviews by UNEP, and most
recently by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)).
However, policy makers have been slow in responding to
the concerns, except in some countries such as France
or Italy that have made tentative steps in the right direction
towards increased regulation. Even so, the increased
regulation does not provide a complete safeguard for
pollinators (EEA, 2013).

EFSA has very recently articulated its concerns about the
risks associated with certain uses of three neonicotinoids
(clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam)4, and it has
asked the European Commission to consider changes
in the regulation of these substances. Opposition from
some Member States, however, and strong lobby efforts
from industry, seem to be slowing down any attempt to
change current approvals in light of the risks that have
been identified. These three neonicotinoids are among
the biggest selling insecticides in the world, and account
for 85% of the neonicotinoid insecticide market worth
$2,236m US dollars in 2009) (Jeschke et al, 2010).
Imidacloprid is the biggest selling insecticide in the world,
with sales of $1,091m in 2009 (Jeschke et al, 2010).

Greenpeace believes that the identified concerns are
compelling enough to reasonably suspend the use of a
number of bee-harming pesticides completely, including
the neonicotinoids. Suspending only certain specific
uses cannot, in itself, guarantee the safety of all species
of pollinators. As the authors of a recent study looking
at the effects of imidacloprid on other pollinators like
flies and beetles observed: “indeed, almost nothing is
known of the impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on the
behaviour of non-target insects other than bees… In
general, it is remarkable how little we understand about
the environmental toxicology of this widely used class of
insecticides.” (Easton and Goulson, 2013).

What we can do
to protect bees and
other pollinators

The threats to both wild and managed
pollinators are real, significant and complex.
Addressing all the threats in an integrated
way will be an immense, yet fundamentally
necessary, task. What seems clear is that
taking steps to address one of the major sets
of the current factors affecting pollinators, i.e.
the impacts of chemical-intensive agriculture,
will be crucial steps in the right direction. Any
progress in transforming the current destructive
chemical-intensive agricultural system into
an ecological farming system will have many
associated benefits on other dimensions of
the environment and of human food security,
besides the clear benefits to global pollinator
health.
Transforming the current system into one that fulfils both
environmental protection ambitions and global food
needs is a daunting task, and one that needs strong
progressive steps towards a robust long-term vision. An
important one of these steps is to work towards avoiding
harm to pollinators by eliminating exposure to potentially
bee-harming pesticides. In doing so, key components of
natural and managed ecosystems will be protected both
directly and indirectly.

In the short to medium term there are specific issues that
modern society can move to address with immediate
effect that will benefit global pollinator health. The benefits
could become evident almost immediately. Based
on analysis of the current science on global pollinator
health, Greenpeace believes that eliminating exposure
to established bee-harming pesticides is a crucial step in
safeguarding bees, both managed and wild, and the high
ecological and fiscal value of natural pollination.

Some examples of scientifically based short to medium
term actions to help reverse the decline of global pollinators
fall into two basic groups:

1) avoid harm to pollinators (e.g. through eliminating
exposure to potentially harmful substances); and

2) promote pollinator health (e.g. through changing
other practices within agro-ecosystems).

Avoiding harm to pollinators by
eliminating use and exposure to
potentially bee-harming pesticides

In the preceding chapters of this report we have
summarised the current science pointing at significant risks
associated with the use of some bee-harming pesticides.
This science is clear and strong: the potential harm of
these pesticides far exceeds any presumed benefits of
increased agricultural productivity. In fact, any perceived
beneficial trade-offs are likely to prove completely illusory.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has confirmed
the potential risks of some of these pesticides (three
neonicotinoids)5, while it is accepted that the economic
benefits of pollinators are, in parallel, very significant.

In addition, the expansion of integrated pest management
(IPM) and organic agriculture, particularly in Europe6,
demonstrates that farming without pesticides is entirely
feasible, economically profitable, and environmentally safe
(Davis et al, 2012). Even in Italy, where the use of some
bee-harming pesticides was suspended for coated seeds
a few years ago, farmers have not reported increases in
pest problems after discontinuing use of these biocides.
On the contrary, farmers reported no statistically significant
decreases in yields as a result of quickly adopting and
observing more judicious regulation of bee-harming
pesticides (APENET, 2011).

Nevertheless, farmers need more support in finding new
ways of protecting their crops against pests in a non-
toxic, environmentally safe way. There is a clear need for
more research and development on those alternatives.
In addition, it will be crucial to increase the promotion of
those alternative solutions that already exist. This should
include support to make them available commercially,
once their efficiency has been trialled and established.

Enhancing the health of
pollinators, both within
agroecosystems and in semi-
natural habitats

Increasing diversity and abundance of flower
resources within agriculture landscapes

Industrial agricultural landscapes are often effective
deserts for bees. When large-scale monocultures
dominate – with few flowering plants, overall low plant
diversity, and large-scale use of herbicides – bees may
find it difficult to find adequate food.

Many practices that increase plant diversity, at different
scales, can improve the flower resources available to
pollinators, both in space and time. For example, at the
scale of individual sites, including crops that provide
large flushes of pollen and nectar – such as red clover,
sunflowers, melon, oilseed rape, or almonds – can
enhance conditions for pollinators in the short term
(Kremen et al, 2007).

At the farm level, pollinators benefit from growing or
preserving alternative forage before and after blooming of
the main crop. Maintaining flower-rich field margins, set
asides, grassy borders or permanent hedgerows (Kremen
et al, 2007; Carvell et al, 2004) are effective ways of doing
this. Intercropping with different varieties of crop plants
that attract beneficial insects, including pollinators, also
serve as a “reservoir” of flowers (Kremen et al, 2007).
Annual communities of plants otherwise regarded as
weeds can also support healthy pollinator communities
(Morandin and Winston, 2006). Orchards and olive
groves, for example, can be managed efficiently, but with
high biodiversity to build habitats for wild pollinators (Potts
et al, 2006).

On a wider, local scale, integrating semi-natural areas into
managed agricultural areas can increase the abundance
of, and pollination services from, wild pollinators. Wild
pollinator abundance in farms is often associated with the
existence of nearby natural or semi-natural areas, and
can significantly increase the production of vegetables,
as shown in the case of field-grown tomatoes in California
(Greenleaf and Kremen, 2006). Increasing the overall
diversity of pollinators to encourage, for example, the
presence of both managed honeybees and wild bees, has
recently been shown to improve pollination success and
fruit production in almond orchards (Brittain et al, 2013b).
In mango orchards, fruit production was significantly
higher per tree in orchards that had a plot of wild flowers
maintained in their margins. Production was also improved
by proximity of the orchard to natural areas, and low
pesticide use (Carvalheiro et al, 2012). Combining native
flower plots with areas of natural habitat within agricultural
regions encourages wild bees in productive areas, and
can boost pollination and yields while at the same time
preventing loss of natural habitats to damaging agricultural
practices.

Wild insect pollinators, mostly many species of bees
but also some flies, butterflies and beetles, are gaining
importance as drivers of pollination services in agriculture
landscapes. A very recent global analysis showed that, in
sites with lower diversity and abundance of wild insects,
crops are less productive regardless of how abundant
honeybees are around a farm site (Garibaldi et al,
2013). This highlights the importance of conserving wild
pollinators not only for biodiversity preservation, but also
for their crucial role in food production. Honeybees are
important, but they cannot replace the efficient pollination
role played by a diversity of wild insects around crops
(Garibaldi et al, 2013).

It has been shown that cherries are pollinated more
efficiently, and thus are more productive, when visited
by wild bees as compared to managed honeybees
(Holzschuh et al, 2012). In turn, the abundance and
diversity of wild bees was linked to natural habitats
maintained in the proximity of the cherry orchard. The
effect of natural habitats and wild bee presence on fruit
productivity is actually rather a strong one: “An increase of
high-diversity bee habitats in the landscape from 20% to
50% enhanced fruit set by 150%.” The authors concluded:
“Farmers need to protect semi-natural habitats in their
landscapes to guarantee pollination and high yields”.
(Holzschuh et al, 2012).

chapter five

Natural pollinators like bumblebees have been shown to
travel longer distances to forage in more diverse flower
patches (Jha and Kremen, 2013). This finding further
suggests that actions to promote species-rich flowering
patches, in both natural and managed landscapes,
could magnify the benefits of wild pollination services.
This offers a great opportunity to involve farmers, land
managers, and even urban dwellers, in actions that
simultaneously promote both biodiversity conservation
and pollination services (Jha and Kremen, 2013).

“The integration of unmanaged land into agricultural areas
can achieve conservation issues and a protection of
ecosystem services at rather low economic costs.”

– Lautenbach et al, 2012

Farming with high biodiversity
and without agrochemicals:
ecological, organic, sustainable
systems

It has been shown that when a site has higher diversity
and abundance of pollinators, crop flower pollination is
more successful, and hence fruit and seed production is
increased. This has been demonstrated in experiments
with oilseed rape crops. Increased yield and greater
market value resulted from increased pollination success
(Bommarco et al, 2012).

Farming at the same time as maintaining high biodiversity,
and without any application of chemical pesticides or
fertilisers as is the case with organic or ecological farming
methods, has repeatedly been shown to benefit pollinator
abundance and richness. These techniques also benefit
crop pollination, and hence potential yields (Morandin
and Winston, 2005; Andersson et al, 2012). However, the
benefits of organic or other non-chemical farming upon
pollinator health remain poorly studied. More importantly,
these alternative methods are often neglected as a
potentially very effective tool for protecting and enhancing
bee populations.

A recent study in Sweden clearly showed how strawberry
crops benefited from organic farming. Organic strawberries
received more pollinators and achieved higher pollination
success than conventionally grown strawberries, and this
difference was evident quickly after the conversion from
conventional to organic farming. The authors concluded
that organic agriculture benefited crop pollination in terms
of both the quantity and quality of the yield. (Andersson et
al, 2012).

Ecological farming practices can benefit both pollinator
diversity and abundance, particularly in more intensively
farmed agricultural landscapes (Batáry et al, 2011;
Holzschuh et al, 2008). This can confer benefits in the
form of achieving full yield potentials in crops (Kremen
and Miles, 2012). A comparison of wild bee abundance
in organic, conventional and genetically engineered (GE)
herbicide-resistant canola farms in Canada showed that
organic canola fields had the highest bee abundance and
the lowest pollination deficits (defined as the increase in
seed production per fruit with supplemental pollination)
compared to either conventional or GE crops (see Figure
2) (Morandin and Winston, 2005). Conventional fields were
intermediate in terms of bee abundance and pollination
limitations, while GE herbicide-tolerant canola showed the
lowest bee abundance and the highest pollination deficit.
Although the reasons for the highest pollination limitation
in GE herbicide-tolerant canola remain uncertain, it seems
plausible that high application of the herbicide glyphosate
could impact bee population health either directly, or
indirectly through a decrease in flower resources. It is
possible that “a genetically modified crop variety designed
to improve yields through weed management might have
the undesired consequence of reducing bee abundance in
the field”, thus limiting crop yield (Morandin and Winston,
2005).

The benefits of organic farming in terms of the diversity
and abundance of pollinators that it supports can also
extend to neighbouring conventional farming sites. In
German wheat fields, organic practices increased richness
of pollinators by 60%, and abundance by 130-160%,
relative to conventional practices (Holzschuh et al., 2008).
Furthermore, the increase of organic farm area at the
landscape level from 5% to 20% enhanced pollinator
diversity and abundance by more than 60% on both
organic and on conventional fields (Holzschuh et al, 2008;
Kremen and Miles, 2012).

Diversified farming systems, like those under organic or
ecological production methods, bring out many benefits
in addition to increased pollination services; they enhance
the control of weeds, diseases, and insect pests (Kremen
and Miles, 2012). However, these systems have received
significantly less public funding for research as a means
of improved management, compared to conventional
farming systems. This lack of support is remarkable,
given that ecological and organic farming systems can
produce approximately the same amount of food and
profits as conventional farming, while generating far fewer
environmental and social harms (Kremen and Miles,
2012; Davis et al, 2012). Estimates by Urs Niggli, director
of the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) in
Switzerland are illuminating. He estimates that, of a budget
of some $52bn annually spent on agricultural research,
less than 0.4% goes towards researching and evaluating
organic-specific initiatives7.

Accordingly, more public and private funding is needed
for research and development on ecological farming
practices that maximise ecological services, alongside
food production and environmental protection, while at
the same time helping social and economic development
(IAASTD, 2009).

Conclusions and
recommendations

Actions needed to protect
the health of bees and other
pollinators.

“The benefit from pollination is high enough in a large part
of the world to seriously affect conservation strategies
and land-use decisions if these values were taken into
account. Implications reach from projects working with
traditional local farmers to provide a sustainable livelihood
to promoting pollinator restoration and conservation
across the world.”

 – Lautenbach et al,  2012

European agricultural policies, first and foremost the
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), should incorporate
current scientific evidence about the benefits of and
threats to populations of both managed honeybees and
wild pollinators. Urgent action is required to protect the
essential ecosystem service of pollination. The evidence
outlined in this report of tools that already exist to protect
pollinators should be incorporated into agricultural
policies as a means of encouraging bee-enhancing
farming practices.

In addition, EU regulations on the use of potentially
bee-harming substances should be emplaced following
rigorously the precautionary principle, incorporating
current scientific evidence about harms and vulnerability
of honeybees, but also extending precaution to other
wild pollinators in light of their crucial role in securing
pollination services now and in an uncertain future.

Recommendations

Honeybees and wild pollinators play a crucial role in
agriculture and food production. However the current
industrial chemical-intensive farming model is threatening
both, and putting European food at risk. As this report
shows, there is strong scientific evidence proving that
neonicotinoids and other pesticides play an important
role in the current bee decline. As a consequence, policy
makers should:

1) Ban the use of bee-harming pesticides, starting
with the top-ranked most dangerous pesticides currently
authorised for use in the EU, i.e. the seven priority
bee-harming chemicals imidacloprid, thiamethoxam,
clothianidin, fipronil, chlorpyriphos, cypermethrin and
deltamethrin.

2) Through the adoption of pollinators’ national action
plans, support and promote agricultural practices that
benefit pollination services within agricultural systems,
such as crop rotation, ecological focus areas at farm level,
and organic farming.

3) Improve conservation of natural and semi-natural
habitats around agricultural landscapes, as well as
enhance biodiversity within agricultural fields.

4) Increase funding for research and development
on ecological farming practices that move away from
reliance on chemical pest control towards biodiversity-
based tools to control pests and enhance ecosystem
health. EU policy makers should direct more funding for
ecological agriculture solutions research under the
auspices of the CAP (direct payments) and Horizon 2020
(EU research framework).
