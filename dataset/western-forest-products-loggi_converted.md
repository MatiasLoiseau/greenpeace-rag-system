32 criteria, WFP was in compliance with 6%, in non-

compliance with 25% and in serious non-compliance with

69%. Of the criteria we were able to assess, we

determined that WFP had an overall failure rate of 94%.

Our assessment finds the CSSP recommendations to

be much more consistent with the FSC’s guiding Principles

and Criteria than WFP’s current and planned forestry oper-

ations. The assessment concludes that WFP’s operations

are far from being certifiable under the FSC system without

f a r-reaching and fundamental changes to the company’s

operations and forest management planning.

W F P   L O G G I N G   P R A C T I C E S

S e c o n d l y, WFP’s position on FSC certification and forest

policy compares sharply with the position taken by

B C ’s leading coastal forestry company MacMillan Bloedel,

whose recent declaration is a significant shift from

traditional BC forest policy. The company intends to phase

out clearcutting of coastal primary forests within 5 years

and to gradually shift from primary forests towards second-

growth forests exploitation within 25 years. In addition,

the company states that certification will be applied as an

effort to satisfy customers.

These overall findings contrast sharply with WFP’s own

publicly stated opinions by their Chief Forester, Bill

Dumont, who has claimed that WFP current operations are

FSC-certifiable without any significant changes to their

activities on the ground. For example, on CBC Radio

(10 June 1998) he said: “I think that our operations… a r e

going to be recognised and we’ll get our [FSC]

c e r t i f i c a t i o n.” Similar statements have been by other WFP

representatives in recent months, in published literature

and to a number of their customers. It is clear that the FSC

name is being used to give some ‘green’ credibility and

marketing advantage to WFP.

This assessment concludes that WFP’s current and

planned operations demonstrate a consistent pattern of

broad non-compliance with the Forest Stewardship

C o u n c i l ’s guiding Principles and Criteria.

The FSC Principles and Criteria require interpretation at

the local level. For this reason, the FSC encourages the

development of regional forest stewardship standards

which are in line with FSC’s mission. This structure makes

the standards relevant to local circumstances within a set

of globally agreed upon Principles and Criteria. The FSC’s

approach provides a system that is accountable to the

The purpose of this study is to provide an early,

indicative assessment of Western Forest Products’

forestry operations as they compare to the Forest

Stewardship Council’s (FSC) Principles and Criteria

for forest management. The study assesses the

probable conformance of WFP’s logging operations

against each of the FSC’s Principles and Criteria,

based on a sample of the information available in the

public domain on WFP’s operations. This analysis

identifies specific conformance or “credibility” gaps

between WFP's current and planned logging practices

and the performance standards that would be

expected by application of the FSC’s Principles and

Criteria in British Columbia. This study is not a

substitute for a full FSC certification assessment. The

full assessment will undoubtedly uncover many more

problems with WFP’s operations. Therefore, while

preliminary, this study provides a useful indication of

the degree which WFP’s operations conform to the

FSC’s guiding principles and criteria.

The FSC is an international, voluntary, forest

management certification and labeling system,

created to promote ecologically and socially responsi-

ble forest use, and help meet growing market demand

for forest products from ecologically and socially

responsible forestry operations. The FSC gives buyers

an opportunity to support good forestry management

through their purchases, and an alternative to buying

from companies that use ecologically destructive

logging and forest management practices. The FSC

provides marketing advantages in Europe, the USA

and other environmentally sensitive markets to

forestry companies certified as meeting the FSC’s

environmental and social performance standards (82).

Canada is a signatory of the Convention on Biological

Diversity, a comprehensive agreement under which

countries commit to a number of steps to secure the

conservation of genetic, species and ecosystem diver-

sity and the sustainable use of biological resources

(15). Actions are to be guided by application of the

precautionary principle (65). The Convention includes

a number of measures relevant to the timber industry

in BC under Article 6 (General Measures for

Conservation and Sustainable Use), Article 7

(Identification and Monitoring), Article 8 (In-Situ

Conservation), Article 10 (Sustainable Use of

Components of Biological Diversity), and Article 14

(Impact Assessment and Minimizing Adverse

Impacts).

Under Article 8(k) Canadian and Provincial

Governments commit to develop or maintain neces-

sary legislation and/or other regulatory provisions for

the protection of threatened species and populations

(15, 65). Existing regulations are considered to

be largely inadequate (24), yet endangered species

legislation proposed by the Canadian government

and widely supported by the public was aggressively

opposed by the Forest Alliance of BC, a timber

industry-funded lobby group of which WFP is an

active and leading member (23). The legislation

was subsequently dropped from the order paper.

similarly has been granted exclusive logging rights via

Coastal First Nations’ communities have tradition-

ally relied heavily on hunting, as well as fishing for

salmon and other marine resources, for subsistence

and income. Forest use has also historically and

currently supported the gathering of medicinal plants

and other non-timber resources by coastal Nations.

Western Forest Products:

Non-Conformance.

We were unable to find evidence of any effective

mechanism employed by WFP to resolve grievances

or for providing fair compensation in the case of loss

or damage affecting the legal or customary rights,

property, resources or livelihood of local peoples.

Virtually all lands on which WFP logs are within

unceded First Nations territories. Clearcut logging on

these lands causes numerous losses and damage.

The evidence indicates that WFP ignores such loss or

damage on an ongoing basis (6, 14, 16, 39, 42).

There is currently no existing policy either within

the BC government or within the policies of WFP to

provide compensation to indigenous peoples whose

customary rights to the land have not been adequately

addressed. Although treaty negotiations for lands

contained in the vast majority of WFP’s operations are

now underway, no compensation or royalties are

paid to First Nations or to escrow accounts by govern-

ment or industry for the extraction of timber from

their traditional territories.

Benefits From the Forest

Forest management operations

shall encourage the efficient use of

the forest’s multiple products

and services to ensure economic

viability and a wide range of

environmental and social benefits.

Compliance with this Principle requires assessments

of the full range of forest products and services using

wholistic ecosystem planning approaches (12, 13, 39, 42).

Such multiple products and services include fish, game,

food plants, medicines, cultural and spiritual sites,

soil, riparian and overall ecosystem functioning, forest

p r o d u c t i v i t y, ecotourism, wildlife and fish habitat,

b i o d i v e r s i t y, wildcrafting, conservation areas, wilderness,

recreation, and other forest products. Efficient use of

multiple products and services implies that only when they

are all recognized and sustained can an environmentally

and socially beneficial, viable long-term economy emerge

(12, 47). Current WFP planning is driven by a too narrow

focus on maximizing timber values at the expense

of seriously compromising other values. WFP is using

clearcutting as the logging methods in 95% of the

cut-blocks reviewed (21, 22, 39, 42).

Overall, we find WFP’s on-the-ground plans are diametri-

cally opposed to the efficient use of the forest’s multiple

products and services. WFP’s plans are to convert areas

containing such multiple products and ecosystem serv i c e s

into areas where many of these will no longer be main-

tained (21).

While WFP has a management plan, as required

under the BC Forest Practices Code, the intent and

content of WFP’s management plan, and the process

by which it was developed, do not correspond to

the ecosystem-based planning, management and

monitoring framework recommended by the

Clayoquot Sound Science Panel (12). The long-term

objectives of management, although stated, are

untenable, given scientific knowledge of ancient

forest life cycles and the functioning of rainforest

ecosystems (12, 13, 21, 36, 39, 40, 42, 52, 53, 69).

As discussed elsewhere in this report, WFP’s

management plans are inadequate since they fail to

effectively achieve the objectives of many of the

elements listed above consistent with the FSC’s

Principles and Criteria. For example, while WFP has

“plans” for the identification and protection of rare,

threatened and endangered species, their effective-

ness in achieving this objective is not scientifically

credible or rigorous (see FSC Criteria 6.2, 36). The

Management Objectives for almost all WFP SPs

researched are “to produce a mixed stand with an

average diameter of 45 cm within an anticipated

90–120 year rotation,” even though the natural forest

is 3–4 times that age and the life history of cedar

is such that few cedar trees will mature to produce

natural forest recruitment before short rotations

are planned to remove them (21).

residents in 1997 found 69% of those surveyed felt

that, with alternative logging practices available,

clearcutting should not be allowed to continue.

Seventy-seven percent of British Columbians believe

that logging of BC’s old growth forests should be

stopped immediately or phased out (37, 61). Despite

this shift in social values, WFP continues to use

clearcutting as its predominant logging practice in

primary forests on publicly held Crown lands (21, 22).

WFP’s selection of species for planting is generally

based on their overall suitability for the site. However,

there is a tendency for WFP’s SPs to accept species

such as spruce/balsam for planting when the natural

forest is dominated by cedar/hemlock: this is likely

attributable to the fact that spruce/balsam lend

themselves to shorter rotations to reach logging age

and are of more economic interest to industry than

cedar/hemlock (21).

The “gaps” which are created by WFP clearcuts are

significantly larger than the typical gaps which occur

through typical disturbance regimes of the natural

they should complement the man-

Principle 10 should only apply to Western Forest Product

tenures to the extent that it is relevant to the management

of its holdings which it has converted from primary forest

to stands meeting plantation definitions as a result of past

under FSC Principle 9. A strong case can be made that

WFP is converting many primary forest stands into planta-

Nonetheless, given that conversion of primary forest to

plantations is prohibited, and as virtually all of WFP’s

logging operations are in primary forests, Principal 10 and

related criteria should not apply and were not a focus of

this report. However, restoration objectives and standards

for existing plantation areas of WFP’s holdings (as well

FSC ANALY S I S

The FSC provides the following Introduction of its purpose and

i n t e n t :

“It is widely accepted that forest resources and associated lands

should be managed to meet the social, economic, ecological, cultural

and spiritual needs of present and future generations. Furthermore,

growing public awareness of forest destruction and degradation has

led consumers to demand that their purchases of wood and other

forest products will not contribute to this destruction but rather

help to secure forest resources for the future. In response to these

demands, certification and self-certification programs of wood

products have proliferated in the marketplace.

The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an international body

which accredits certification organizations in order to guarantee the

authenticity of their claims. In all cases the process of certification

will be initiated voluntarily by forest owners and managers who

The FSC recognizes that there is a continuum of forest management

intensity and resulting forest condition. This continuum includes

p r i m a ry, undisturbed natural forest, (with all or most of the character-

istics and functions of the natural forest ecosystem), well-developed

s e c o n d a ry and semi-natural forests (with many or some of the

characteristics and functions of the natural forest ecosystem), and

plantations (with few or no characteristics of the natural forest

ecosystem). The decision to categorize and evaluate a managed forest

(a management regime applied to a specific forest type) as a “natural

forest” or as a “plantation” must be made at a local level, and should

be guided by clearly articulated FSC-endorsed regional standards,

when such standards exist. These standards may include further

conditions and restrictions on plantation management. The FSC also

recognizes differences between plantations of exotic species and

those of native species. Plantations composed of exotic species

inherently pose more risks than those of native species, and will

require additional ecological and social safeguards. These safeguards

request the services of a certification organization. The goal of the

and other vegetation types may be prepared at national and local

levels. The P&C are to be incorporated into the evaluation systems

and standards of all certification organizations seeking accreditation

by the FSC. While the P&C are mainly designed for forests managed

for the production of wood products, they are also relevant, to

v a rying degrees, to forests managed for non-timber products and

addressed in national and local forest management standards. These

standards are to be developed in each country or region involved, and

will be evaluated for purposes of certification, by certifiers and other

involved and affected parties on a case by case basis. If necessary,

FSC dispute resolution mechanisms may also be called upon during

the course of assessment. More information and guidance about the

certification and accreditation process is included in the FSC Statutes,

other services. The P&C are a complete package to be considered as

Statutes, Procedures for Accreditation and Guidelines for Certifiers.

The FSC P&C should be used in conjunction with national and

international laws and regulations. FSC intends to complement, not

supplant, other initiatives that support responsible forest manage-

on perfection in satisfying the P&C. However, major failures in any

individual Principles will normally disqualify a candidate from

certification, or will lead to decertification. These decisions will be

taken by individual certifiers, and guided by the extent to which

each Criterion is satisfied, and by the importance and consequences

of failures. Some flexibility will be allowed to cope with local

c i rcumstances.

The FSC will conduct educational activities to increase public

awareness of the importance of the following: 1) improving forest

management; 2) incorporating the full costs of management and

production into the price of forest products; 3) promoting the highest

and best use of forest resources; 4) reducing damage and waste;

and 5) avoiding over-consumption and over- h a rvesting. The FSC will

also provide guidance to policy makers on these issues, including

improving forest management legislation and policies.”

Letter from Hereditary Chiefs

“ We do not support the clearcutting of old growth in Ingram-Mooto.

H E I LTSUK CHIEFS TELL WESTERN FOREST PRODUCTS

TO “DEFER LOGGING OUR LAND”

This is wrong.” said Chief Harvey Humchitt, “WFP is ignoring our

request for a one-year deferral even though the Delgamuukw and

Gladstone cases acknowledge that First Nation people have the right

to financially share in the benefits of development in their homelands.”

In early April, 70 Heiltsuk representatives sailed to Ingram-Mooto to

with the community. Since then WFP has continued road building and

plans to log the pristine valleys using conventional clearc u t t i n g

despite concerns of the Hemas Council.

“ We have watched our resources and economic opportunities being

taken away and yet we depend on these for our food and survival. Our

salmon, abalone, halibut, cod, sea cucumbers and now our trees are

being removed,” said Hemas spokesperson Harvey Humchitt. The

Heiltsuk have been here since time began and will remain here until it

ends. “We want the logging of the Ingram-Mooto and all removal

of resources to stop until we can have a voice in determining what

happens in our homeland. We owe this to our future generations and

to the land and sea which provide for us. We want the logging of

old growth to stop for the sake of all British Columbians.”

Western Forest Products is one of the largest logging companies

which operate in Heiltsuk territory. They remove huge amounts of

timber every year and yet provide only a few jobs for the Heiltsuk

people. Recently, WFP stated their wish to become certified as being

an environmentally and socially responsible logging company under

the Forest Stewardship Council. However, the FSC clearly states that,

“indigenous peoples shall control forest management on their lands

and territories unless they delegate control with free and informed

consent to other agencies.” The hereditary chiefs sent a letter to the

FSC protesting WFP's activities.
