Introduction
The EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) provides
data to the public regarding toxic air and water
emissions from a large number of industrial facilities
and locations across the United States.
1
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst
and the Political Economy Research
Institute (PERI) have long taken this data, combined
facilities under the same parent company, and
assessed the share of their pollution that falls on
low-income and communities of color. This
information is published in their annual Top 100 Polluter
Indexes.
2
This briefing takes PERI’s latest air toxics dataset
3
(based on 2018 TRI data) and calculates toxic
air pollution and environmental justice metrics not
across parent companies, but industrial sectors.
The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act (EPCRA) of 1986 established the
TRI, which has proven to be a key source of information
for communities living near industrial sites.
Because the TRI tracks such a wide diversity of toxic
chemical releases, EPA has also developed
the Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI)
data to synthesize TRI emissions data into
simpler risk indices.
4
Different chemicals have different toxicity levels
and different exposure pathways, and the
demographics of nearby communities vary from facility
to facility. For each facility, the RSEI can be
thought of as combining (emissions) x (toxicity) x
(exposed population) data into one “toxic score.”
PERI conducts further analysis using finer grained
geographic microdata (RSEI-GM) to estimate
the percentage of each facility toxic score that is
borne by minority and low-income populations.

Past studies of TRI data have found that facilities and industries that report to TRI have a
disproportionate impact on low-income and communities
of color.

This 2018 data confirms the
trend of widespread environmental injustice across
TRI-reporting sectors. Considering the
aggregate toxic score across all 15,552 facilities
analyzed here, the overall minority share is 47.8%
and the low-income share is 17.6%. Table 1 shows that
pollution burdens for five environmental
justice groups are larger than the national averages for the U.S. population.

To perform our sectoral analysis we group facilities
according to their reported North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.
9
NAICS
is the standard system used by the federal
government to classify business establishments for
the purpose of collecting statistical data.
In this briefing, we provide analysis and discussion
of sectors and sub-sectors responsible for the
pollution reported by TRI, and we also provide more
detailed analysis of certain specific sectors
associated with the oil and gas, petrochemical, and
plastics industries.
Economic Sectors Clustered by NAICS Code
In this section we present toxic scores and environmental
justice metrics from the full 2018 PERI
air toxics dataset, as grouped by industrial sector.

representing a facility reporting under TRI. Each record contains the TRI ID, facility name, parent
company, TRI emissions data, RSEI toxic scores, and
a 6-digit NAICS code. For each facility, PERI
uses the RSEI-GM data to calculate the share of the
toxic score that is borne by five populations:
minorities, Hispanic, African-American, poor, and
near-poor.
10
NAICS is a hierarchical classification system and
a 6-digit code represents the finest level of detail
among economic sectors. The smaller the number of
digits in the NAICS code represents a
broader grouping of facility types, while a larger
number of digits represents a more specific
gradation.
To give an example, NAICS
325211
represents “Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing”
facilities, and is a subset of:
●
32521
(“Resin and Synthetic Rubber Manufacturing”),
●
3252
(“Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and
Synthetic Fibers and Filaments
Manufacturing”),
●
325
(“Chemical Manufacturing”), and
●
32
, which is one of three general “Manufacturing”
sectors.
It is important to note that not all sectors or facilities
are required to report TRI data and so only a
selection of NAICS codes appears in the TRI and PERI
data. TRI does not encompass some of the
most widespread and deadly forms of pollution, including
criteria air pollutants such as particulate
matter, ozone, and nitrogen oxides. Many of the facilities
included in this data are also significant
sources of this criteria air pollution.
We present results from aggregating the 2018 toxic
score records at the 3, 4, 5 and 6-digit NAICS
levels. A full, sortable spreadsheet of the results
can be viewed
here
. Full details of these
groupings and re-calculations are found in the Technical
Notes section below.
Table 2 and Figure 1 show the top 10 industrial sectors
by total toxic score at the 3-digit NAICS
level. There are 49 3-digit NAICS sectors in the PERI
dataset, but these top 10 sectors represent
more than 95% of the total reported toxic score.

of the
total RSEI Toxic Score which is borne by minority
and low-income people, respectively . Sectors with
a disproportionate

population averages) are highlighted in red, while
the others are
green.

panels represent the
proportion of minority and poor people in the 2018
U.S. population (39% and 14%, respectively). Sectors
with minority
and poor shares lower than those national proportions
are marked green.
The chemical manufacturing sector (325) accounts for
over 40% of the total reported toxic score,
and various types of metal and equipment manufacturing
are also top polluting sectors. The
Petroleum and Coal Product Manufacturing (324) sector
is #7 on the list, which we will discuss in
greater detail below.
Among the top 10 sectors, we can see that 7 sectors
have toxic burdens that disproportionately
impact minorities, and only one sector (Nonmetallic
Mineral Product Manufacturing, 327) has a
lower-than-average burden for both minority and low-income
people. Of these 10 sectors, Waste
Management & Remediation (562) has the highest minority
and low-income shares. Petroleum and
Coal Product Manufacturing (324) has a minority share
of 56% and a poor share of 19%.

Because these high-level aggregations combine very diverse industries, it is often useful to look at
finer levels of aggregation. Table 3 and Figure 2 show the top 20 industrial sectors by total toxic
score at the 6-digit NAICS level, the most specific
level of aggregation. There are 406 6-digit
NAICS codes in the PERI dataset, and these top 20
sectors represent over 70% of the total
reported toxic score.

Table 3
: Top 20 polluting sectors at the 6-digit NAICS level. Minority and Poor Share represent the percentage of the
total RSEI Toxic Score which is borne by minority and low-income people, respectively . Sectors with a disproportionate
burden (compared to 39% minority and 14% low-income
population averages) are highlighted in red, while
the others are
green.
Figure 2

panels represent the
proportion of minority and poor people in the 2018
U.S. population (39% and 14%, respectively). Sectors
with minority
and poor shares lower than those national proportions
are marked green.
The same general sectors are represented in this top
20, but with more fine-grained detail:
●
Key sectors that contribute to the overall Chemical
Manufacturing toxic score include,
Surface Active Agents, Petrochemicals, Pesticides
and Agricultural Chemicals, Plastics and
Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and two catch-all categories
for Other Basic Organic and
Inorganic Chemicals.
●
The Petroleum and Coal Products toxic score is largely
due to emissions from Petroleum
Refineries.
●
Other key sectors include Aircraft Parts, Electroplating,
and Steel Foundries.
Again, most of these sectors show disproportionate
impacts on minorities (17 out of 20 sectors)
and low-income populations (19 out of 20).
Oil & Gas Focus
Meeting the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C
will require rapid reductions in coal, oil and gas
production
11
and consumption, particularly in scenarios
that don’t rely heavily on CCS or negative

emissions technologies.
12
A managed phase-out of the fossil fuel industries,
13
consistent with
climate limits, brings with it the potential for large
co-benefits from air pollution reductions -- and
the
potential to alleviate entrenched patterns of environmental injustice. To fully achieve the air
pollution, public health, and environmental justice
benefits of decarbonization, policy makers will
need to explicitly include those goals in their policy
design.
14
For these reasons, we provide more detail in this
section on a few segments of the oil and gas
lifecycle that report to TRI and appear in the PERI
dataset, including:
●
Petroleum Refineries (324110, 147 records)
●
Petroleum Bulk Stations and Terminals (424710, 407
records)
We report top-level statistics for a few other oil
and gas-related sectors, including:
●
Asphalt Paving, Roofing, and Saturated Materials Manufacturing
(32412, 325 records)
●
Other Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing (32419,
76 records)
●
Oil and Gas Field Machinery and Equipment Manufacturing
(333132, 51 records)
●
Motor Vehicle Gasoline Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing
(336310, 31 records)
There are also several additional oil and gas-related
NAICS codes that appear in the PERI dataset,
but which have only small numbers of records or are
not comprehensive across the sector. We do
not analyze these sectors further, but they include
the following:
●
Petroleum and Petroleum Products Merchant Wholesalers
(424720, 2 records)
●
Natural Gas Extraction (21113, 5 records)
●
Pipeline Transportation (486, 2 records)
●
Support Activities for Oil and Gas Operations (213112,
5 records)
●
Oil and Gas Pipeline and Related Structures Construction
(237120, 4 records)
●
Air and Gas Compressor Manufacturing (333912, 7 records)
●
Fossil Fuel Power Generation (221112, 449 records)
-- natural gas power plants are not
required to report TRI data, so this category comprises
only plants that burn coal or oil.
In addition, some fraction of emissions from many
industrial sectors may be ultimately the result of
on-site use of fossil fuels for energy and heat.
To gain a complete picture of the Petroleum Refining
industry we need to re-classify a few records
in the dataset. Comparing against the EIA’s 2020 Refinery
Capacity report,
15
we note that six
petroleum refineries are listed under NAICS codes
other than 324110, while some records in that
sector (with generally smaller toxic scores) are tank
farms or other related facilities. To match our

dataset to the EIA report, we reassigned these facilities giving a revised refinery dataset of 133
records (full details on these reassignments included
in the Technical Notes section below).
The added six facilities increase the overall toxic
score for petroleum refineries (from 8.42 million
reported above to 9.40 million), but do not significantly
change the minority (56.4%) or poor shares
(18.5%) of the sector from what was reported above.
These changes would nudge Petroleum
Refineries into #8 on the list of top polluting sectors,
and put Petrochemical Manufacturing into
#9.
16
To visualize the environmental justice impact of this
sector, we plot minority share vs. poor share
for refineries in Figure 3. The area of each circle
is proportional to the total toxic score for the
facility, and the top 10 most polluting refineries
are labeled. Facilities located to the right of the
vertical red line (representing the 39% of the country
who are minorities) have a toxic impact that
falls disproportionately on minority communities.
Facilities located above the horizontal red line
(representing the 14% of the country who are low-income)
have a toxic impact that falls
disproportionately on low-income communities.

national proportion of minorities (39%) and poor people (14%). The red dot represents the sector-wide average toxic
score.
The figure shows that half of refineries and a majority of the total toxic score (6.30 million) are
found in areas that are
both
disproportionately minority
and disproportionately low-income (upper
right quadrant).
Figure 4 shows the same 133 refineries, but this time
plotting total minority share (left) and
low-income share (right) against total toxic score.
In this plot, facilities with especially high
environmental justice impact are found to the upper
right, signifying high overall emissions and
high minority or low-income share.

: Minority (left) and poor (right) shares
plotted against total toxic score (on a logarithmic

refineries. The red lines represent the 2018 national
proportion of minorities (39%) and poor people (14%).
We conduct a similar analysis for Petroleum Bulk Stations
and Terminals (after removing 3
misclassified refineries and adding in 17 misclassified
terminals). Figure 5 shows that emissions
from these facilities are much smaller than from refineries,
but that they are more numerous and
are again disproportionately found in minority and
low-income communities (1.18 million total toxic
score, 71.3% minority share, 19.1% poor share).

Petrochemical and Plastics Focus
The impact of plastic production and use on the environment
and the climate has become a
high-profile issue in recent years. In this section,
we take a closer look at the air toxic impacts of
the petrochemical sector and other sectors along the
plastics supply chain, notably the following
NAICS codes:
●
Petrochemical Manufacturing (325110, 48 records, after
removing 1 refinery)
●
Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing (325211,
333 records)
●
Plastics Product Manufacturing (3261, 838 records)
The 48 records under Petrochemical Manufacturing also
disproportionately impact minority and
low-income communities. Indeed, all of the top 10
most polluting facilities are located in the
upper-right quadrant of Figure 6. Although this sector
has a similar total toxic score to the
Petroleum Refinery sector, the Petrochemical sector
is marked by a few very large emitters in
contrast to a broader range of refineries with significant
emissions.
Removing one refinery from this category decreases
the overall toxic score for Petrochemical
Manufacturing (from 9.20 million reported above to
8.88 million), but does not significantly change
the minority (66.0%) or poor shares (18.2%) of the
sector from what was reported above.
Figure 6
: Minority and low-income shares of the toxic
emissions from 48 Petrochemical Manufacturing facilities.
The red
lines represent the 2018 national proportion of minorities
(39%) and poor people (14%). The red dot represents
the
sector-wide average toxic score.

and low-income share (right) against total toxic score.

plotted against total toxic score (on a logarithmic
scale) for 48
petrochemical facilities. The red lines represent
the 2018 national proportion of minorities (39%) and
poor people (14%).
We conduct a similar analysis for two subsequent stages
of the plastic manufacturing process:
Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing (325211),
and a broader sector containing different
forms of Plastics Product Manufacturing (3261). Figure
8 shows these facilities in one plot with
Plastics Materials in blue and Plastic Products in
red.

Unlike Petrochemical Manufacturing, the plastics material
and product manufacturing facilities in
this dataset do not show a disproportionate impact
on minority communities, although they do
show a higher impact on low-income communities. Table

We are grateful to Michael Ash and Rich Puchalski of PERI for providing their latest dataset for this
analysis.
The PERI “air facilities” dataset contains the following
information for each facility:
●
TRI ID
●
Facility Name
●
Street Address, City, State
●
Parent Company and ID
●
“Split” flag noting facilities which are divided between
two owners
●
6-digit NAICS code
●
TRI reported air, incineration, and total (air+incin)
releases (in pounds)
●
RSEI toxic scores for air, incineration, and total
(air+incin) releases
●
“Revised” versions of the TRI and RSEI fields in the
case that facilities revised their
reporting. PERI notes for this version “no revisions
were made.”
●
Five environmental justice ratios describing the percentage
of that facility's toxic score
which impacted minority, hispanic, black, poor, and
near poor populations (derived from
RSEI-GM data).
●
Flags relating this dataset to a separate GHG dataset.
The full air facilities dataset contains 15,700 records
from which we remove 178 records that are
missing EJ ratios, leaving 15,552 records for this
analysis. For further information see also the
Technical Notes for the Toxic 100 Indexes.

For each facility, multiplying the EJ ratios by the
toxic score gives the share of total toxic burden
for
that group. Those toxic score shares can then be summed
over all facilities in the sector, for
example:
𝑇𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦, 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 =𝑖∑ (𝑇𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡, 𝑖×𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦, 𝑖)
𝑇𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡, 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 =𝑖  ∑ 𝑇𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡, 𝑖
We then recalculate sector-wide EJ ratios:𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦, 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟=𝑇𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦, 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 / 𝑇𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡, 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes
a report of petroleum refinery capacity,
the 2020 version of which includes 133 refineries
across the U.S. Comparing this list against the
147 records under NAICS 324110 indicates a handful
of facilities that are misclassified and some
facilities that report under two IDs, either to TRI
or to EIA.
6 petroleum refineries were found listed under different
NAICS codes (3 under 424710, 1 each
under 221112, 325311, and 325110). These records have
large toxic scores and two are among
the most polluting refineries in the nation. The six
refineries are:

Royal Dutch Shell’s manufacturing complex in Norco, LA “features both refining and
chemicals facilities” according to the
company website
.
There are two TRI records for the
complex, both of which are listed as 325110 (Petrochemical Mfg) in the PERI dataset.
However, the current TRI website (using 2019 data)
classifies the “Norco West” site (TRI
identifier
70079SHLLL1205R
) as 324110 (Petroleum Refineries)
and the “Norco East” site
(
70079SHLLL265RI
) as 325110. Following this, we reassign
the West site to 324110 in our
revised dataset and keep the East site as 325110.
●
Marathon’s
Los Angeles Refinery
has two units located
in Carson and Wilmington, CA that
started
reporting as one entity
in 2019. The refinery
appears under 424710 (Petroleum Bulk
Stations and Terminals) in the PERI dataset, although
it is listed as 324110 on the current
TRI website (
90749RCPRD1801E
). We reassign this record
to 324110 in our revised
dataset.
●
Marathon’s
Galveston Bay Refinery
has two units in
Texas City, TX that merged in 2018.
The refinery has crude oil refining capacity of 585,000
bpcd and also hosts 1,055 MW of
electrical production capacity. Perhaps for that reason,
it is listed as 221112 (Fossil Fuel
Power Generation) in the PERI dataset but 324110 on
the TRI website
(
7759WBLNCH2415T
). We reassign it to 324110 for our
revised dataset.
●
Marathon’s
Salt Lake City Refinery
is listed in both
the PERI dataset and on the TRI
website (
84103MCLCM474WE
) under 424710 (Petroleum
Bulk Stations and Terminals).
We reassign it to 324110 for our revised dataset.
●
Phillips 66’s
Ponca City Refinery
is listed in both
the PERI dataset and on the TRI website
(
74603CNCPN1000S
) under 424710 (Petroleum Bulk Stations
and Terminals). We reassign
it to 324110 for our revised dataset.
●
CHS’s McPherson Refinery is listed in the PERI dataset
and on the TRI website
(
67460NTNLC2000M
) as 325311 (Nitrogenous Fertilizer
Manufacturing), but the
company
website
notes the refinery “relies on crude oil from
Canada and distributes products
throughout the northern tier of the United States.”
CHS also produces
fertilizers and crop
inputs
. We reassign it to 324110 for our revised dataset,
removing it from 325110
(Petrochemical Mfg).
In addition:
●
17 records listed as 324110 in the PERI data are found
to not be operating refineries, but
rather tank farms, terminals associated with refineries,
or specialty operations. These
records generally have smaller toxic scores. We reassign
these 17 records to 424710 in our
revised dataset.
●
5 refineries reported to TRI under two distinct records,
while one refinery was listed as two
units in the EIA report, but only once in the TRI
data. In many of these cases, the separate
TRI records are for “East” and “West” units of the
same refinery.
●
5 refineries in the EIA report do not appear in the
TRI data. These are small operations and
some may have been idled during the 2018 TRI reporting
time period.
●
3 refineries were reported in the PERI database under
two owners, due to a 50-50
partnership. We combined those records and summed
the toxic scores and emissions
values.
