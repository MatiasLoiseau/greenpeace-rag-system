INTRODUCTION

KFC is one of the most prominent fast food brands around the
world. Its parent company Yum! Brands Inc., a company based
in Louisville, Kentucky, USA claims to be the world’s largest
fast food company 1 and last year reported revenue of more
than US$12 billion.2

Greenpeace International research has revealed that KFC is
sourcing paper for its packaging products from rainforests.
This has been confirmed in China, the UK and Indonesia.
Products found to contain rainforest fibre include cups, food
boxes, French fries holders, napkins and the famous chicken
buckets. Greenpeace research has tracked a number of
these products back to Asia Pulp & Paper (APP), a company
that continues to rely on rainforest clearance in Indonesia.
By purchasing from APP and by using paper made from
rainforests, KFC and its parent company Yum! are driving
the destruction of forests in countries like Indonesia. These
forests are a key defence against climate change and are
habitat for many protected species including the critically
endangered Sumatran tiger.

Unlike a number of other major international companies,
KFC and Yum! have no sustainability policies to exclude
commodities connected to rainforest destruction. In fact,
the group has consistently failed to even answer questions
about its sourcing of products such as palm oil, soya and
paper products. This is in contrast to Yum!’s main competitor
McDonalds which has played an important role addressing
deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.  While its supply chain
still contains significant risks, McDonald’s has introduced
policies to begin to address its forest impacts. 3

Greenpeace is calling on KFC, and its parent Yum! to
immediately implement policies to exclude deforestation from
their supply chains and to suspend the use of any products
from APP while it continues to clear Indonesia’s natural forests.

ASIA PULP & PAPER -
DRIVING RAINFOREST
DESTRUCTION

APP is the pulp and paper division of the
Sinar Mas group4 and claims to be the third
largest pulp and paper manufacturer in the
world.5 It aspires to be number one,6 and
by the rapid scale of its expansion it could
very well be on track.7 Yet APP’s operations
come at a devastating cost for the people
dependent upon Indonesia’s forests, for
endangered species like the Sumatran tiger
and for the future of the world’s climate.
Indonesia’s own data from the National
Council on Climate Change (DNPI) position
it as the world’s third largest GHG polluter;8
it attributes some 85% of these emissions to
land use – almost entirely from deforestation
and peatland degradation.9

In February of this year Greenpeace
International released the results of a year-
long investigation into APP which found
that the company is systematically violating
Indonesia’s laws protecting ramin, an
internationally protected tree species.10 The
investigation, undertaken at APP’s largest
pulp mill in Indonesia, Indah Kiat Perawang,
on the island of Sumatra, has exposed how
illegal ramin logs are regularly mixed into

its supply of rainforest logs from natural
rainforest clearance. By processing ramin for
pulp, APP is also undermining CITES,11 the
same international conservation agreement
governing trade in protected species that
covers ivory and tiger body parts.

These revelations come on the back of years
of evidence showing that APP’s empire
is built upon the systematic clearance
of natural forest to feed its increasing
fibre consumption.12 Despite repeated
claims that APP will end its reliance on
natural forest clearance the company has
comprehensively failed to reach this goal.
APP has been blacklisted by a host of major
international brands, a number of which
tried and failed to encourage the company
to reform its practices. NGOs such as
Rainforest Alliance and WWF have also
attempted to work with APP to reform its
practices, but without success.13, 14

Global companies that have ruled out supply
from APP include Nestlé15, Kraft16, Xerox17,
Unilever18, Adidas19, Mattel20, Mondi21,
Metcash22, Hasbro23 and Danone24.

APP is chasing the
fast food sector

containers represents over two
thirds (72%).26

4

In its quest to become the
world’s largest pulp and paper
company, the food packaging
sector is an important market
for APP. Approximately half the
world’s pulp production goes
into making packaging paper
and board.25 Of this, packaging
for food and beverage

A significant proportion of
APP’s paper production27 is
dedicated to packaging and
most of its paperboard brands
are certified for use in food
grade packaging.28 Some
mills have developed special
food grade products such as
Foopak,29 or focus exclusively

on food packaging, like Jin
Feng Yuan Paper (Shanghai)
Co., Ltd (liquid packaging and
cup board).30 APP China’s
brand new 600,000 tonnes/
year paperboard mill Guangxi
Jingui Pulp & Paper Co., Ltd31
is to be ‘one of the world’s
largest forest-pulp-paper
production base and [will]
strive to become APPs base for
paper packaging of liquids’.32

I do not want to later explain to
my granddaughter Almira that
we, in our time, could not save
the forests and the people that

rhinoceroses, and orangutans
vanished like the dinosaurs.

Sumatran tigers –
under threat

The Sumatran tiger is the last
species of tiger left in Indonesia,
with the other two tiger species
having become extinct more
than 40 years ago.34 Today, only
400 Sumatran tigers exist in
the wild35 and the species has
suffered a rapid loss of habitat in
the past decade.

In 2003, 80% of Sumatra’s peat
swamp forest was identified
as tiger habitat. Between
2003 and 2009, Sumatra
lost nearly a third or 800,000
hectares of these same peat
swamp forests. Some 22%
of this loss occurred in areas
currently allocated to APP’s log
suppliers. 36

Greenpeace mapping analysis
of data from the Indonesian
Ministry of Forestry shows that
APP’s pulpwood suppliers
have been a significant driver
of the clearance of Sumatra’s
peat swamp forests, a key
habitat for the endangered
Sumatran tigers. This has
pushed tigers into closer
contact with humans, often
with tragic consequences for
both sides.37

Some of the rainforest fibre
identified in KFC packaging is
coming from APP mills which
are fed from cleared Sumatran
tiger habitat. KFC and its parent
company Yum! are therefore
helping to drive the Sumatran
tiger closer to extinction.

New Evidence:
APP’S ON-GOING
RELIANCE ON
RAINFOREST
CLEARANCE

APP has committed on three separate
occasions to end its use of natural forest
fibre. In 2004 the company pledged to use
only plantation fibre by the end of 2007.38   In
2007, it changed the date, this time giving
the end of 2009 as a target.39 The most
recent statements from APP have moved this
commitment back to 201540 – the company
therefore acknowledges it will continue to
clear rainforests until at least 2015. And, of
course, given its history there is no reason to
believe this latest commitment will be met.

In 2012, natural forest clearance has
continued, including areas of peat swamp
forests mapped as habitat for the Sumatran
tiger. The Kerumutan Peat Swamp Forest41 in
Riau is one of Indonesia’s last remaining areas
of extensive forested peatland. The landscape
has been designated a regional priority for
the survival of tigers in the wild.42 APP is
supplied from six concessions in Kerumutan,
totalling over 150,000 hectares.43 Mapping
analysis shows that these concessions cover
significant areas of deep peat and forested
tiger habitat.44 PT Mutiara Sabuk Khatulistiwa
is one of these suppliers. It was identified
in a confidential 2007 Sinar Mas Forestry
document as a target supply area, with a
size of 45,000 hectares.45 Analysis reveals
that 100% of the area is mapped as peatland
greater than 3 metres deep, and more than
90% of the area was forested tiger habitat
in 2006.46 Forest clearance and peatland
drainage has been repeatedly documented by
Greenpeace, most recently in February 2012
(see pictures right). These peat swamp forests
are also habitat for the protected tree species
ramin, the same species repeatedly identified
waiting to be pulped at APP’s largest mill,
Indah Kiat, Perawang.

AND THEIR ROLE IN

EVIDENCE OF THE

COLONEL’S DIRTY

LITTLE SECRET

KFC is the largest fast food brand within the Yum!
company, which also includes Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
Yum! boasts over 37,000 outlets in 120 countries with
4 new outlets opening each day outside the US.47 Its
aggressive expansion into developing countries has been
successful in recent years, particularly in China where it
now derives more sales than from its US outlets.48

evidence that the company has a comprehensive
policy to tackle environmental impacts in its supply
chain, rather it relies upon a few isolated examples
or pilots of ‘best practice’. Repeated formal requests
from Greenpeace in the US, the UK, India and in the
Netherlands over many years for information about
sustainability commitments have gone unanswered.

In 2006, KFC reached the milestone of selling more than
one billion chicken dinners for the year.49 Yum! spent
over half a billion dollars on advertising in 201150 and
KFC can boast as being the world’s first brand visible
from outer space after deploying a huge 87,000-square
foot banner in the Nevada desert in USA in 2006.51

8

Disappointingly, KFC and Yum! spend far less time and
resources dealing seriously with the environmental
impact of their business. Yum! acknowledges that
‘...it’s our responsibility to understand and mitigate
our environmental impact globally’.52 Yet a thorough
examination of Yum!’s public materials shows no

Greenpeace investigations have revealed that KFC
uses paper products that contain rainforest fibre in at
least three countries: the UK, China and Indonesia. A
number of the KFC products in the UK and Indonesia
have been traced through chain of custody research
back to APP. The presence of rainforest fibre was
confirmed through fibre species analysis of KFC
products sampled in those countries, by specialists
at the Institution for Paper Science and Technology,
in Germany or Integrated Paper Services, US. Further
fibre analysis of a Pizza Hut packaging product from
Indonesia, another Yum! Brand, also tested positive for
significant levels of rainforest fibre.

EVIDENCE OF THE
COLONEL’S DIRTY
LITTLE SECRET

UK
KFC UK’s website states that ‘We are confident about the origin and
impact of material used in our packaging because all of our suppliers are
certified as 100% sustainable by independent third parties such as the
FSC or SFI, and can demonstrate through their entire supply chain that
their product is renewable’.53

However, Greenpeace investigations have revealed that KFC’s
foodboxes, like the ‘Streetwise Lunchbox’ and ‘Snackbox’, have been
manufactured from APP paperboard produced at the Indah Kiat Serang
mill54 on Java island, Indonesia. Neither these, nor any other products
from this mill, are credibly certified. This mill is known to receive
significant amounts of pulp from APP’s largest pulp mill, Indah Kiat
Perawang on Sumatra, which continues to be supplied by rainforest
timber, including from forested peatland and tiger habitat.55 In August
of 2011, Greenpeace commissioned fibre testing for the packaging of
various KFC products.

Seven out of the 10 KFC food boxes sampled in the
UK showed mixed tropical hardwood (MTH), i.e.
rainforest fibre, as the main hardwood component
of these products. Three of these products recorded
levels of over 50% MTH including the KFC Popcorn
box and the KFC Streetwise lunch box. The other
key fibre source found was acacia, the predominant
plantation species APP’s suppliers are planting to
replace cleared natural forests.

In March 2012, 3 out of 3 KFC food boxes collected from KFC outlets
in the UK also tested positive for MTH as part of the hardwood
component, mixed with acacia.

China
Since at least 2010, several of APP’s companies have been boasting on
their websites about providing packaging products to KFC in China. 56
On the ground, undercover investigations and inquiries by Greenpeace
have corroborated this on a number of occasions.57 Greenpeace
commissioned fibre testing for a number of products obtained from KFC
China stores between 2010 and 2012, including paper cups, tissues
and perhaps the most iconic of KFC’s packaging; the Chicken Bucket.
Rainforest fibre was repeatedly identified in products over this period.
One bucket contained more than 50% rainforest fibre.

Indonesia
In April 2012, Greenpeace investigations revealed that APP’s paper mill
PT Pindo Deli (Java, Indonesia) supplies KFC Indonesia with luncheon
napkins (see image to the left). Fibre species analysis in April 2012 found
some mixed tropical hardwoods in this product, mixed with a high
content of acacia.

A separate APP company, PT Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimia has also been
promoting their new grease-proof packaging line by featuring a range
of KFC products (paper bag, sandwich wrap and chicken fillet box).58
Several KFC products sampled from Indonesia tested positive for MTH
after being sent for expert analysis. These products include paper
cups and French fries holders, with MTH positive results recorded from
samples collected as recently as March 2012.

Research into another of Yum!’s brands, Pizza Hut, has provided
evidence that rainforest fibre is also being used in  the production of
their paper-based packaging. Fibre analysis of triangular pizza boxes
collected in April this year in Jakarta from a Pizza Hut store has revealed
significant levels of MTH present. The boxes have been produced by PT
Letter Mas Industry, a confirmed customer of APP.59

CREATING RECIPES
FOR DEFORESTATION

KFC’s parent company Yum! stands out within
the fast food sector for failing to deal seriously
with its environmental impact upon forests.  No
brand in the group has taken comprehensive
action to source commodities sustainably, yet
this has not stopped the group’s companies,
including KFC, from trying to jump on the
green bandwagon.

the issues. McDonald’s has more recently
introduced a land management commitment
covering all commodities linked to
deforestation, which specifically addresses
wood fibre used in packaging.  It has criteria
that rule out supply from Asia Pulp and
Paper due to a refusal to accept wood fibre
from cleared forests.63

In the UK, KFC stopped using palm oil as part
of its cooking processes in 2011, claiming
that its position was influenced by concern
for rainforests, ‘you won’t find us using palm
oil in our restaurants now…hopefully the
orang-utans will find their homes have been
left well alone.’60

In the US, KFC has come under sustained
criticism from US environmental groups.  The
NGO ‘Dogwood Alliance’ has run a campaign
for years taking aim at the environmental
issues behind fast food packaging – not
surprisingly KFC stands out as the laggard.64
Dogwood claims:

The real story is rather different. KFC
continues to cook products in palm oil in
markets such as India, with no evidence of
sustainable sourcing. The company is not a
member of the Roundtable for Sustainable
Palm Oil (RSPO) in any country in which it
operates. At Yum!’s AGM in 2011, the board
of directors helped vote down a proposal to
procure sustainable palm oil for KFC, Pizza
Hut and Taco Bell restaurants.61

Numerous reports and campaigns from
environmental groups have exposed Yum!/
KFC’s failure to source other products, such
as soya and pulp and paper responsibly.   In
2006, following the release of a Greenpeace
report showing the links between major
food companies and forest destruction in
the Amazon, a number of companies, led
by McDonalds, demonstrated leadership
by refusing to purchase soya that originates
from newly deforested areas.62 KFC failed
to even respond to correspondence on

‘ KFC’s packaging is directly contributing to
the destruction of our Southern forests [of the
US]. While other leading fast food companies
are working hard to adopt sustainable
packaging policies, KFC continues to make
its famous buckets from trees that were
“harvested” from endangered forests across
the South, including The Green Swamp – a
unique, irreplaceable forest in Brunswick
County, North Carolina...It was a vital
resource for hunting, fishing and sustainable
forestry since long before The Colonel
perfected his secret recipe...’65

Yum! Brands Inc. based in Louisville, Kentucky,
USA has the ability to determine  purchasing
policy for its brands and outlets across the world
just as it controls branding and other aspects
of the business. For this reason Greenpeace
is calling upon Yum!’s US based CEO, David
Novak to finally take  these issues seriously and
demonstrate the leadership he is known for
within business circles on other issues.

‘ Deforestation is one of the
principal drivers of climate
change, accounting for 17%
of greenhouse gases today.
The consumer goods industry,
through its growing use of
soya, palm oil, beef, paper and
board, creates many of the

Greenpeace is calling on KFC’s parent
company Yum! and other companies to:

Stop the destruction

•  Immediately suspend direct and indirect purchases
of any paper products, including but not limited to
food packaging, from any APP group company until
APP implements commitments to stop clearance of
natural forests and peatlands.

•  Publicly support political action for permanent

protection of peatland and natural forest areas in
Indonesia.

Start the solution

Implement a global, zero-deforestation
procurement policy:

•  Establish targets and timelines for reducing the use
of paper and packaging and increasing the use of
recycled fibre. Where this is not possible, use virgin
fibre that is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified.

•  Report annually on the percentages of types of

papers from these different sources.

•  Conduct an analysis to determine which other
commodities – such as palm oil, beef or soya
–   should be prioritized to cut deforestation out
of your supply chain. Implementing plan for that
prioritization.

Ensure Your Suppliers:

•  Do not procure commodities produced

or traded illegally.

•  Avoid business with companies linked to

deforestation.

•  Respect the free and prior consent of indigenous

peoples and other traditional forest users.

•  Adopt and enforce ‘no-kill’ policies to avoid deaths
of endangered wildlife within plantations and other
infrastructure.

•  Avoid commodities linked to conflict, including
conflict wood, which was produced or traded in
a way that drives violent conflict.

•  Invest in business practices that prevent

deforestation and support clean, low-carbon
development.

  Comparing DNPI data (published 2009, source
for 2010 report) with data from other top emitting
countries (China, USA, Brazil, India, Russia)
positions Indonesia as the world’s 3rd largest
GHG polluter in 2005. For a fuller explanation see
Greenpeace International, ‘Protection Money’,
endnote 5, p56 www.greenpeace.org/international/
en/publications/reports/Protection-Money/

   DNPI, ‘Setting a course for Indonesia’s green
growth’ Press conference presentation 6
September 2010: p.5 gives net deforestation
emissions as 763mt, peat decomposition as 300mt
and peat fire as 550mt in 2005. DNPI ‘Indonesia’s
greenhouse gas abatement cost curve’ August
2010: pp. 14, 19 gives the same total but divided as
772mt from peat and 838mt from other land-use
and forestry-related sources.
