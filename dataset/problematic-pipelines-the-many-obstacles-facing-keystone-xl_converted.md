Problematic
Pipelines

The many obstacles facing Keystone XL

There are compelling reasons to question
whether TransCanada Corporation should
proceed with Keystone XL in the midst of
federal and state legal challenges to permits,
and escalating Indigenous and landowner
opposition; in the absence of a Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement for the
newly approved alternative pipeline route;
and given the potentially changed political
landscape in 2020. This briefing outlines
various obstacles facing the construction and
commercially viable operation of Keystone
XL. We suggest questions institutional
financiers may wish to ask TransCanada.
On January 18, 2018, TransCanada
confirmed that it has secured approximately
500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20
year commitments. While TransCanada
has described these commitments as
evidence of ‘strong commercial support’,1
they amount to only 60% of Keystone XL’s
capacity (as against a normal expectation of
securing 80%), and include a subsidy from
the Alberta government in the form of a
50,000 bpd commitment.2

On November 20, 2017, the Nebraska
Public Service Commission (PSC) approved
an alternate route for Keystone XL, and
denied Transcanada’s Preferred Route.
The authority of the PSC to approve an
alternative route is being challenged in the
courts by Nebraska landowners.

The PSC decision raises further questions

about the adequacy of the existing

environmental analyses conducted at the
state and federal levels. TransCanada’s own
expert witness at the PSC hearings discussed
the many ways in which the now approved
route would pose greater environmental
impacts than the Preferred Route.3

In November 2017, TransCanada’s
Keystone 1 pipeline spilled 5,000 barrels.4
According to Reuters, Keystone 1 has
leaked more often and in greater volume
than was anticipated in its original impact
assessments.5 The November spill, which
raised concerns about systemic issues with
the pipeline, led the vice-chair of the South
Dakota Public Service Commission to raise the
prospect of revoking Keystone 1’s permit.6

Major risks to Keystone XL

•  2014 federal Final Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement
does not cover new approved route
•  Legal challenge to the validity of
Nebraska PSC decision and upcoming
PSC elections
•  Over 100 landowners in Nebraska
refusing to sign over their land7
•  Federal legal challenge to federal
cross-border permit
•  Escalating Indigenous and landowner
opposition.
•  Commercial viability

Nebraska
PSC decision:
Not the route
TransCanada
was looking
for

The Nebraska Supreme Court will hear
arguments in the case against the PSC’s
ability to approve an alternative route in late
2018. It would be prudent for TransCanada
to delay proceeding with Keystone XL
pending certainty over the validity of the
Nebraska pipeline route approval.

On November 20, 2017, every
member of the Nebraska PSC voted to
reject TransCanada’s proposed route
for Keystone XL through Nebraska.8 In
a split 3-2 decision, the Nebraska PSC
instead approved an alternative route (the
Mainline Alternative route).9

In contrast to TransCanada’s statement
that “the approved route was based on
a comprehensive review of the evidence
submitted by all parties,”10 the Mainline
Alternative route was not in fact reviewed
by state regulators, TransCanada never
submitted an application for the route
that was approved, landowners on the
route were never notified that they could
be impacted by a new pipeline, and some
Nebraska lawyers question whether the
PSC had the authority to approve the
alternative route.11

Questions for financiers to ask
TransCanada

•  Will the company delay proceeding
with Keystone XL until all challenges
to the Nebraska PSC have been
adjudicated?
•  Given the changed route and the
company’s revised construction
timetable, what is the company’s
revised cost estimate for Keystone XL?

Acting
without
authority?
Legal
challenge to
the Nebraska
PSC route
approval

On December 27, 2017, Nebraska
landowners filed an appeal of the
PSC decision to approve the Mainline
Alternative route. Landowners will argue
that, under the applicable Nebraska
statutes, the PSC was not empowered
to approve any route other than
TransCanada’s Preferred Route because
TransCanada had only applied for and
provided materials in relation to their
Preferred Route, and that therefore
TransCanada must file a new permit
application for the as-yet-unsurveyed or
reviewed route with the PSC.12 Written
arguments must be submitted by May
1, 2018 and oral hearings are likely to
be scheduled by the end of 2018. If the
appeal is successful, TransCanada will have
to file a new application specifically for
the Mainline Alternative route, the review
of which by the Nebraska PSC could take
from 7 months to 1 year. This review would
include new environmental studies and
public hearings. That new review may be
decided by newly-elected Commissioners.
The Nebraska PSC, the five-member,
elected pipeline route permitting agency
in the state, will see two Commissioners’
seats up for reelection in 2018. Several
pipeline opponents have already filed to
run against incumbents in these races, and
a win in one or both races would expect to
tilt the PSC against Keystone XL, should
a new pipeline permit come before the
agency again in 2018 or 2019.

It would be prudent for TransCanada to
delay proceeding with Keystone XL pending
certainty over the validity of the Nebraska
pipeline route approval.

The need
for a new
Environmental
Impact
Statement

•  stating that the Mainline Alternative
route would mean crossing the
ranges of four more threatened and
endangered species of fish not present
along the Preferred Route and hence
not fully evaluated: the pallid sturgeon,
the Topeka shiner, the sturgeon chub,
and the lake sturgeon;
•  stating that the Mainline Alternative
route would also disturb additional
land and sensitive areas, including
5.6 additional miles crossing highly
erodible soils, 2.2 additional miles
crossing Ecological Unusually Sensitive
Areas, and one additional mile crossing
through deciduous forest and has 10
more Perennial Stream/River crossings
than the Preferred Route;
•  setting out a chart showing that the
Mainline Alternative route would have
additional impacts on the habitat of the
threatened Northern Long-Eared Bat
and Western Prairie Fringed Orchid as
compared to TransCanada’s Preferred
Route; and
•  stating that the Mainline Alternative
route “in addition to impacting
landowners with the Keystone
pipeline already on their property...,
would impact approximately 39 new
tracts with approximately 30 new
landowners.”

Federal legal challenge to federal
cross-border permit
In March 2017, the Northern Plains
Resource Council, Sierra Club, Bold Alliance,
Natural Resources Defense Council, Center
for Biological Diversity and Friends of
the Earth sued the Trump administration
in federal district court in Montana over
what they claim was a rushed approval of
the federal permit for the pipeline.13 The
lawsuit challenges the U.S. Department
of State’s and other agencies’ inadequate
and outdated environmental review of the
pipeline, which relied on an environmental
impact statement completed in January
2014 and failed to consider key
information on the project’s impacts.
In motions filed mid-2017, the
administration and TransCanada argued
that, in approving the pipeline, the
administration was not required to comply
with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) or the Endangered Species Act
(ESA). These arguments were dismissed
as without legal merit on November 22,
2017.

The decision of the Nebraska PSC to
approve a route which federal agencies
have never evaluated strengthens the
plaintiffs’ claim that the administration
needs to do a new review under
environmental laws like NEPA and, the
ESA., and the Clean Water Act.

expert witness, Dr. Jon A. Schmidt to
the Nebraska PSC laid out many of the
additional risks of the Mainline Alternative
route:14

Northern Plains Resource Council, Sierra
Club, Bold Alliance, Natural Resources
Defense Council, Center for Biological
Diversity and Friends of the Earth
claim in their lawsuit that these new
impacts require the State Department to
reevaluate the environmental impacts of
Keystone XL in a Supplemental EIS.15

A decision on the plaintiffs’ motion
for summary judgment is expected to be
made by September 2018. A victory for
the plaintiffs - at this stage or following
a more lengthy hearing - would likely
invalidate the Trump Administration’s
cross-border permit, meaning that
in addition to a new supplemental
environmental impact statement being
required, the US State Department would
have to undertake a new National Interest
Determination and issue a new permit. This
process could take the permitting process
into 2019 or even 2020 when political risk
may be a factor to be considered.

Alternative
Route not

statements

06

However, the Mainline Alternative
route does not fully correspond to any of
the Final SEIS alternatives. It mirrors the
Preferred Route through the north of the
state, then diverges in Antelope County,
crosses Madison County, and seems to
meet up with the I-90 Corridor route in
Stanton County. This section of the I-90
Corridor route uses the existing right-of-
way for the Keystone 1 pipeline. There also
seems to be a discrepancy further south
in Seward County where the PSC curve
juts westward. So at the very least, the
Madison County crossing is entirely un-
analyzed by the 2014 State Department
Final SEIS.

In the 2014 Final Supplemental
Environmental Statement (SEIS),16 the
State Department originally considered
eight routes, including TransCanada’s
proposed project route (black line, in map
below). The State Department screened
those alternatives17 and identified
two routes for further evaluation and
comparison with the proposed route:18
•  2011 Steele City Alternative (light
red line), which had been the original
proposal in the 2011 EIS
•  I-90 Corridor Alternative (green line)
Compare this map against the Nebraska
PSC map in Figure 1. The Preferred Route is
the same in both maps (green for Nebraska
PSC, black for the State Department), as is
the 2011 Steele City Alternative (PSC calls
it the Sandhills Alternative, marked in red).

five counties not included in the Final
SEIS, and has never been evaluated by
the State Department or other federal
agencies.”21

Questions for financiers to
ask TransCanada

•  In light of the company’s own
expert’s testimony on the
environmental impact of the
Mainline Alternative route, why does
TransCanada not agree that prudent
risk mitigation and management
would require a new assessment of
environmental impacts?
•  If the legal challenge to the federal
cross-border permit is successful,
would TransCanada challenge that
ruling ? If so, what impact would such
a challenge have on the project’s
construction timing and cost?
•  What is the company’s estimate of
the impact on construction timing
and cost if the legal challenge to
the federal cross-border permit is
ultimately successful? What is the
company’s assessment of political
risk should timing slip until 2020?
•  What risks (including reputational
and legal risks) does the company
believe arise in the event that,
regardless of the outcome of ongoing
litigation, a new environmental
impact analysis is not undertaken?
How does the company propose to
address such risks?

The section of Mainline Alternative
route that does coincide with the I-90
Corridor Alternative and the Keystone
Right of Way did not receive the same
level of analysis or scrutiny in the Final
SEIS. Much of the analysis is of limited use
because it aggregates information about
the entire I-90 Corridor route (e.g. total
miles of wetland crossed along route), and
doesn’t provide specific information about
the section coincident with the Mainline
Alternative route in Nebraska. The fact
that this section is coincident with the
existing Keystone 1 Right of Way does
not mean that the 2008 EIS document
for that pipeline is a substitute for a new
assessment given it is ten years old,
would not address any cumulative issues
pertaining to placing two pipelines in the
same area, and doesn’t address any issues
that arise from aggregating information
along the route.19

Comparing the Mainline Alternative
route with various routes studied in the
U.S. State Department Final SEIS20, we find:
•  There is one section of the Mainline
Alternative route (crossing Madison
County) that is entirely un-studied.
•  There is another longer section (along
the existing Keystone Right of Way)
that received only limited analysis in the
Final SEIS as one segment of a separate
alternative route (the I-90 Corridor).
However, that I-90 Corridor analysis
was considerably less detailed than
the Preferred Route analysis, and is
additionally of limited usefulness since
much of its data is aggregated along
that route and is not specific to the
section coincident with the Mainline
Alternative route. The applicants in
the federal lawsuit challenging the
federal cross-border permit do not
consider the limited analysis of the I-90
corridor to be adequate, stating that
the Mainline Alternative route “crosses

Public
opposition
intensifies

Nearly 20,000 people across the US have
committed to “traveling to the pipeline
route to engage in peaceful, creative
resistance to Keystone XL when the call is
put out by frontline communities to help
stop this Black Snake.” 22 The “Promise
to Protect” is a growing network of
individuals and organizations and was
initially launched following the Nebraska
PSC decision in November 2017. The
“Promise to Protect” coalition includes,
among others, Native Organizers Alliance,
350.org, Greenpeace USA, Indigenous
Environmental Network, Dakota Rural
Action, as well as the Cheyenne River Sioux
Tribe, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe,
and the Pawnee Nation. Two Indigenous
resistance camps close to the proposed
route in South Dakota, Wiconi Un Tipi
and Wapka Was’te, are organized and
active through the winter.23 Following the
Nebraska PSC decision, the Treaty Alliance
Against Tar Sands Expansion, made up of
more than 150 First Nations and tribes,
affirmed its opposition to the project.24

08

Nebraska landowner opposition
The Nebraska Easement Action Team
(N.E.A.T.), a collective formed in 2012
of landowners who have refused to sell
easements to TransCanada for Keystone
XL, continue to seek out newly affected
landowners on the Mainline Alternative
route. NEAT and Domina Law Group
are hosting community meetings in the
affected counties and soliciting additional
landowners to join the organization.25
Several landowners have built barns and
large solar installations on their property in
the direct path of the proposed Keystone
XL pipeline.26

Questions for financiers to
ask TransCanada

•  How does the company intend
to overcome the opposition of
landowners in Nebraska who have
refused to sell easements? If they
continue to refuse, what would be
the impact on Keystone XL in terms
of construction timing and cost?
•  What is the company’s estimate
of the costs of entering legal
proceedings with over 100
landowners in Nebraska?
•  Is the company conducting a
thorough and independent human
rights impact assessment of the
project in line with the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human
Rights Reporting Framework?
•  How does the company plan to address
the risks arising from Indigenous
opposition to Keystone XL?
•  In light of the Dakota Access Pipeline
controversy, what public reporting
will the company do on securing free,
prior and informed consent (FPIC)
from affected tribes?

commercial

prospects for additional growth. Market
fundamentals such as evolving supply
and demand dynamics and the resulting
medium to long- term prospects for oil
prices have already restricted the growth in
tar sands and are likely to continue to do so.
Expert evidence32 submitted to the
Nebraska PSC consultation on Keystone
XL highlights the conditions limiting
growth in the tar sands and thus limiting
the potential supply to the pipeline
and the potential economic impacts. In
addition, there are conditions specific to
the Keystone XL pipeline and the already
over-supplied refining market in the Gulf
of Mexico area which, it is argued, would
impact the success of Keystone XL.

Questions for financiers to
ask TransCanada

•  Why is the company confident that
it will secure additional shipping
contracts for Keystone XL given
the unfavourable current market
dynamics for tar sands growth?
•  Has the company assessed the
impact of reduced global oil demand
due to factors including the rapid
adoption of new technologies such
as EVs?
•  What would be the impact on
Keystone XL’s profitability if shippers
sought to renegotiate contracts
in the event of an oversupply of
pipeline capacity?

As stated above, TransCanada has secured
commitments for only 60% of Keystone
XL’s capacity. The commercial success of
Keystone XL relies on producers fulfilling
the multi-year shipping commitments
they have made. Given that evolving
market conditions raise questions about
the continued expansion of tar sands
production, the risk to TransCanada
is an oversupply of pipeline capacity.
Oversupply of pipeline capacity could
return the negotiating leverage to the
shippers, with the possible outcome being
the renegotiation of the favourable “take
or pay” contracts in their favour reducing
the revenue of TransCanada.

Additional volumes from tar sands
projects already under construction might
exceed available existing pipeline capacity
only by about 250 kpd – well below what
is required to profitably fill a new pipeline.27
Growth in the tar sands is dependent on

market conditions (in addition to market
access infrastructure and a lack of climate
policy), including the global demand for oil in
the context of alternative supplies at lower
prices. A number of factors impacting those
market conditions means that growth in the
tar sands is far from guaranteed suggesting
that the optimism of the pipeline companies
in growth is misplaced.

The Canadian oil industry has not
sanctioned construction of any major
new projects that would significantly
increase the overall supply of crude oil
available for export from Canada, since
2014.28 The high prices of 2013 led to
a level of optimism in the industry which
has rapidly eroded. Only one small project
was approved in 2015 and two in 2016.29
Medium term price outlook does not
provide confidence that new projects will
get a green light. The exodus of some
leading international oil companies3031
from the tar sands supports arguments
questioning the province’s long-term

Conclusion

While TransCanada wishes to describe
recent developments as milestones on
the way to constructing Keystone XL,
legal challenges to federal and Nebraska
approvals together with escalating
Indigenous and landowner opposition
suggests the company would be prudent
to delay proceeding in the midst of such
uncertainty. The approval of an alternative
route in Nebraska, which TransCanada’s
own expert suggested would result in
greater environmental impacts, raises
doubts on the adequacy of the existing
SEIS as a risk identification and mitigation
measure. Potential institutional financiers
of Keystone XL would be prudent to
require TransCanada carry out of a new
environmental impact assessment as a
condition precedent to financial close.
