Millions At Risk – Dangerous to Whom?  
 
There is a fundamental irony and injustice at the heart of  the climate change problem. Today’s  
growing body of e vidence of climate change indicates very clearly that the first and worst 
impacts of climate change ar e being felt by t he poor in the developing world.  Drought in sub -
Saharan Africa, floods in China and India, and a near tripling of people affected by extreme 
weather and other natural disasters globally in the last two decades, almost all in the developing  
world, affecting t hose who are most vulnerable and least able to cope. The responsibility for the 
problem, however, lies elsewhere, primarily in the rich countries of the OECD but increasingly 
with rapidly industrializing countries.  
 
Defining the Risk  
 
Martin Parry, et al’s paper “Millions at Risk”1, which draws together key findings from the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC)  Third Assessment Report, throws t hese 
issues into stark relief.  It plots the increasing numbers of people at risk from water shortage, 
malaria, hunger and coastal flooding from climate change against various future scenar ios for 
global temperature rise. By 2050 t he numbers are shocking  and by 2080, even more so : 
additional tens of millions of people at risk of hunger and coastal flooding, additional hundreds 
of millions at risk of malaria, and 3 billion  or more additional people at risk of water shortage.   
 
While varying estimates for the socio -economic baseline for development could change these 
numbers, three centra l messages emerge:  
 
1. Unmitigated climate change will have absolutely unacceptable human costs;  
2. There are enormous benefits to keeping global temperature rise well below 2° C; and  
3. In the long term, an  aggressive emissions reduction  regime is necessary to k eep 
climate change impacts within a range to which it is possible to adapt.   
 
A substantial degree of ‘dangerous climate change’ is already with us, and more is unavoidable. 
The climate regime must seek both to minimize the damage and at the same time pro vide the 
means for adaptation to those most vulnerable.  
 
Costs – Human and Economic  
 
There has been much discussion in the climate debate about the relative merits and costs of 
mitigation vs. a daptation . Some large emitting countries have argued that the e mission 
reductions  dictated by the science for mitigating climate change are t oo expensive. However, the 
cost of inaction is  likely to be many times higher. While it is difficult to come up with precise 
predictions of the economic costs of a particular deg ree of climate change, the economic 
damages associated with the impacts outlined in the Parry, et. al., paper referenced above would 
run into the hundreds of billions per annum. The economic disruption associated with a major 
shift in global agriculture, d roughts, floods, coastal flooding, forest fires and an increase in 
vector -borne diseases would be enormous. When compounded by millions of refugees fleeing 
flooded coastal areas, abandoning lands that no longer will support them, the costs may be 
incalcula ble.

Evidence  as to the likely costs of adaptatio n to climate change is hinted at  by the many billions 
of dollars already being spent by the governments of rich countries at present to adapt to climate 
change. A new report for Greenpeace by the New Econom ics Foundation, which will be 
released at COP 10, outlines current spending  by rich countries in order to protect themselves 
again st climate change. Contrast these billions  with the USD 410 million per year pledged by 
some industrialized countries for both  mitigation and adaptation in developing countries at COP 
72, (which will supposedly become available in 2005) and the conceptual dysjunct and hypocrisy 
are clear. France alone is spending nearly twice that amount in response to the European heat 
wave in 2 003…while OECD governments continue to subsidize the fossil fuel industry to the 
tune of around 73 billion USD/year.  
 
Sustainable Development?  
 
While the international community is wrest ling with its failure to date to make progress in 
meeting the Millenn ium Development Goals, a new awareness is emerging that one of the 
greatest threats to sustainable development is climate change itself. In recognition of this, a 
broad cross -section of environment and development organizations joined forces in the UK to 
call for new models of development that will be both climate -proof and climate friendly  and that  
address climate change adaptation issues in the context of development. Up In Smoke3 outlines 
the requirement for m assive new funding to address the growing nee d for disaster preparedness 
and relief measures in the face of increasing climate change -induced disasters; calls for a global 
assessment of the damages costs associated with adapting to climate change; and seeks a 
renewed commitment to achieving the Mille nnium Development Goals as well as avoiding 
dangerous climate change, while acknowledging that the two have become inseparable.  
 
Climate change presents humankind with an unprecedented challenge. We need global 
cooperation in responding to a planetary -scale problem over many decades and ulti mately over 
centuries, with actions  predicated on our best understanding of their ef fects far into the future. 
At the same time the urgency for immediate action cannot be overstated. We need:  
 
- a dramatic tran sformation of our energy system - a ‘new industrial revolution’ to create a 
low carbon economy;  
- massive expenditures to adapt to the changes to which we have already committed 
ourselves through the profligate spending of our ‘carbon budget’ over the past century 
and a half;   
- to provide the means for those in the developing world mos t vulnerable to climate 
change - yet who are not responsible for the problem - to develop in a sustainable matter 
in a world subject to climate change, with an equitable sharing of the wo rld’s resources 
within our planet’s means.  
 
…and we need to do all these things at the same time.  
  
  
Climate change is a threat to all of us, North and South. While the North bears the primary 
burden of historical responsibility, it is clear that an effec tive response in terms of both 
mitigation and adaptation requires a renewed commitment to sustainable development by all 
governments and sectors of society.
